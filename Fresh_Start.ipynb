Knockdown of nearly a thousand genes reduced rhythm amplitude; these are presumably due to toxic effects on cells. Hundreds of genes potently modified period length or increased amplitude.\n",

Abstract: The synthesis, characterization, inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I, and biological evaluation of a series of oligopeptide-substituted bisindolylmaleimides 7-12 are described.

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.\n",

Abstract: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) encodes a heterotrimeric helicase-primase comprised of the products of three of the seven DNA replication-specific genes. Several dihalo-substituted derivatives of N2-phenylguanines and 2-anilinoadenines weakly inhibited the intrinsic DNA-dependent NTPase activity of the HSV1 helicase-primase, and these compounds inhibited the DNA-unwinding activity of the enzyme. The primase activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by 3,4- and 3,5-dichloroanilino derivatives of adenine and 2-aminopyrimidines. These compounds and nucleoside analogs of 2-(3,5-dichloroanilino)purines inhibited viral DNA synthesis in HSV1-infected HeLa cells in culture but also inhibited cellular DNA synthesis, likely as a result of inhibition of cellular primase and/or DNA polymerases.\n",

The model, termed \"Quantized Surface Complementarity Diversity\" (QSCD), defines molecular diversity by measuring molecular complementarity to a fully enumerated set of theoretical target surfaces. Molecular diversity space is defined as the molecular complement to this set of enumerated surfaces. Using a set of known test compounds, the model is shown to be biologically relevant, consistently scoring known actives as similar. At the resolution of the model, which examines molecules \"quantized\" into 4.24 A cubic units and treats four points of specific energetic complementarity, the minimum number of compounds needed to fully cover molecular diversity space up to volume 1070 cubic A is estimated to be on the order of 24 million molecules. Most importantly, QSCD allows for individual points in diversity space to be filled by direct modeling of molecular libraries into detailed 3D templates of shape and functionality.\n",

Most of the analogues were prepared by oxidation of camptothecin to 10-hydroxycamptothecin (2) followed by a Mannich reaction to give N-substituted 9-(aminomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins (4-12) or by subsequent modification of Mannich product 4 (13, 15, 17, 19, 21). Others were obtained by modification of the hydroxyl group of 2 (25,26) or by total synthesis (35,42,43). These analogues, as well as some of their synthetic precursors, were evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I, cytotoxicity, and antitumor activity. Although there was not a quantitative correlation between these assays, compounds that inhibited topoisomerase I were also cytotoxic and demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo. Further evaluation of the most active water-soluble analogue led to the selection of 9-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-10-hydroxycamptothecin (4, SK&F 104864) for development as an antitumor agent. In addition to its water solubility, ease of synthesis from natural camptothecin, and high potency, 4 demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in preclinical tumor models and is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.\n",

            "Title: Modification of the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin: inhibition of mammalian topoisomerase I and biological activity.  Abstract: Several camptothecin derivatives containing a modified hydroxy lactone ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Each of the groups of the hydroxy lactone moiety, the carbonyl oxygen, the ring lactone oxygen, and the 20-hydroxy group, were shown to be critical for enzyme inhibition. For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex. With a few exceptions, those compounds that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action. One of these compounds was tested for antitumor activity and was found to be inactive. The present findings, as well as other reports that the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin is critical for antitumor activity in vivo, correlate with the structure-activity relationships at the level of topoisomerase I and support the hypothesis that antitumor activity is related to inhibition of this target enzyme.\n",

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.\n",

            "Title: Antiretroviral agents as inhibitors of both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase and protease.  Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type one integrase (HIV-1 integrase) is required for integration of a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into a host chromosome and for HIV replication. We have previously reported that phenolic moieties in compounds such as flavones, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), tyrphostins, and curcumin confer inhibitory activity against HIV-1 integrase. We have investigated the actions of several recently described protease inhibitors, possessing novel structural features, on HIV-1 integrase. NSC 158393, which contains four 4-hydroxycoumarin residues, was found to exhibit antiviral, antiprotease, and antiintegrase activity. Both the DNA binding and catalytic activities (3'-processing and strand transfer) of integrase were inhibited at micromolar concentrations. Disintegration catalyzed by an integrase mutant containing only the central catalytic domain was also inhibited, indicating that the binding site for these compounds resides in the central 50-212 amino acids of HIV-1 integrase. Binding at or near the integrase catalytic site was also suggested by a global inhibition of the choice of attacking nucleophile in the 3'-processing reaction. NSC 158393 inhibited HIV-2, feline, and simian immunodeficiency virus integrases while eukaryotic topoisomerase I was inhibited at higher concentrations, suggesting selective inhibition of retroviral integrases. Molecular modeling studies revealed that the two hydroxyls and two carbonyl moieties in NSC 158393 may represent essential elements of the pharmacophore. Antiviral efficacy was observed with NSC 158393 derivatives that inhibited both HIV protease and integrase, and the most potent integrase inhibitors also inhibited HIV protease. Hydroxycoumarins may provide lead compounds for development of novel antiviral agents based upon the concurrent inhibition of two viral targets, HIV-1 integrase and protease.\n",

The parent compound 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin (8) was derived from a Friedlander condensation between the known aminopyridine derivative 3-(3-amino-4-picolylidene)-p-toluidine and optically active tricyclic ketone 7. Compound 8 had activity approximately twice that of (20S)-camptothecin in the calf thymus topoisomerase I cleavable complex assay.

Abstract: A series of compounds structurally related to staurosporine, rebeccamycin, and corresponding aglycones was synthesized, and their activities toward protein kinase C and topoisomerases I and II were tested together with their in vitro antitumor efficiency against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. Their antimicrobial activities were also examined against a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), a yeast (Candida albicans), and three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Streptomyces chartreusis, and Streptomyces griseus). To avoid side effects expected with protein kinase C inhibitors, we introduced substitution on the maleimide nitrogen and/or a sugar moiety linked to one of the indole nitrogens to obtain specific inhibitors of topoisomerase I with minimal activities on protein kinase C. As expected, these structures were inefficient on topoisomerase II, and some of them exhibited a strong activity against topoisomerase I. Generally, dechlorinated compounds were found to be more active than chlorinated analogues against both purified topoisomerase I and protein kinase C. On the other hand, opposite results were obtained in the cell antiproliferative assays. These results suggest lack of cell membrane permeability in the absence of the chlorine residue or cleavage of carbon-chlorine bonds inside the cell.\n",

Abstract: In the course of structure-activity relationships on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing a halogenoacetyl substituent were synthesized with the expectation of increasing the interaction with DNA, possibly via covalent reaction with the double helix. Two rebeccamycin analogues bearing an acetyl instead of a bromoacetyl substituent were prepared to gain an insight into the role of the halogen atom. The new compounds show very little effect on protein kinase C and no covalent reaction with DNA was detected. However, the drugs behave as typical topoisomerase I poisons, and they are significantly more toxic toward P388 leukemia cells than to P388/CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. The introduction of a bromo- or chloro-acetyl substituent does not affect the capacity of the drug to interfere with topoisomerase I either in vitro or in cells. One of the bromoacetyl derivatives, compound 8, is the most cytotoxic rebeccamycin derivative among the hundred of derivatives we have synthesized to date. In addition, we determined the antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, and against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a novel class of topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors that are cytotoxic in cancer cell cultures and are therefore under development as potential anticancer agents. As inhibitors of the DNA religation reaction occurring after DNA cleavage by the enzyme, they are classified as top1 poisons, similar to the camptothecins. Two strategies were employed in order to further develop the structure-activity relationships of the indenoisoquinolines and enhance their therapeutic potential. The first strategy involved the synthesis of indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrid molecules to take advantage of a proposed structural analogy between the indenoisoquinolines and camptothecin. The desired hybrids were synthesized by reaction of halogenated phthalides with a dihydropyrroloquinoline. The second strategy involved the attachment of various alkenyl substituents to the C-11 position of the indenoisoquinolines, which were assumed to project into the DNA minor groove. The required C-11-substituted indenoisoquinolines were synthesized by McMurry reactions of 11-ketoindenoisoquinolines with aldehydes, and the geometries of the resulting alkenes were established by nuclear Overhauser effect difference NMR spectroscopy. All of the new indenoisoquinolines were examined for cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures as well as for activity vs top1. Although the indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrid molecules proved to be less cytotoxic and displayed less activity against top1, an analogue incorporating a 3'-aminoalkenyl substituent at the C-11 position of the indenoisoquinoline system was significantly more potent than the prototype indenoisoquinoline in both assays.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a class of noncamptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors that display significant cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures. They offer a number of potential advantages over the camptothecins, including greater chemical stability, formation of more persistent cleavage complexes, and induction of a unique pattern of DNA cleavage sites. Molecular modeling has suggested that substituents on the indenoisoquinoline lactam nitrogen would protrude out of the DNA duplex in the ternary cleavage complex through the major groove. This indicates that relatively large substituents in that location would be tolerated without compromising biological activity. As a strategy for increasing the potencies and potential therapeutic usefulness of the indenoisoquinolines, a series of compounds was synthesized containing polyamine side chains on the lactam nitrogen. The rationale for the synthesis of these compounds was that the positively charged ammonium cations would increase DNA affinity through electrostatic binding to the negatively charged DNA backbone, and the polyamines might also facilitate cellular uptake by utilization of polyamine transporters. The key step in the synthesis involved the condensation of Schiff bases, containing protected amine side chains, with substituted homophthalic anhydrides, to afford cis-3-aryl-4-carboxy-1-isoquinolones. These isoquinolones were then converted to indenoisoquinolines with thionyl chloride.

The synthesis relied on the condensation of substituted Schiff bases with homophthalic anhydrides to produce cis-3-aryl-4-carboxyisoquinolones that were cyclized to indenoisoquinolines in the presence of thionyl chloride. Both top1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity maximized in a single compound, 6-[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminopropyl]-5,6-dihydro-2,3-dimethoxy-8, 9-methylenedioxy-5,11-dioxo-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline hydrochloride (19a), which proved to be a very potent top1 inhibitor having a 110 nM mean graph midpoint (MGM) when tested for cytotoxicity in 55 human cancer cell cultures.

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.\n",

Abstract: Compounds bearing an acyl group of a various size at 1'-OH of shikonin were synthesized as acyl analogues of shikonin, which was isolated from the root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, and evaluated for inhibitory effect on topoisomerase-I activity. A selective acylation at 1'-OH of shikonin in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine gave rise to a good yield of corresponding acylshikonin derivatives. In general, analogues with an acyl group of shorter chain lengths (C2-C6) exerted a stronger inhibitory action than those with longer chain lengths (C7-C20). While the halogen substitution at C-2 of the acetyl moiety failed to increase the inhibitory potency, the placement of double bonds in the acyl group (C5-C7) augmented the potency remarkably. Of the 32 derivatives evaluated, 15 compounds exhibited a higher inhibitory effect than shikonin. Noteworthy, the inhibitory potency of acetylshikonin, propanoylshikonin, and 4-pentenoylshikonin was approximately 4-fold greater than that of camptothecin. All these data suggest that the size of acyl moiety is important for the enhancement of potency, and the presence of olefinic double bonds is also beneficial.\n",

Both top1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity maximized in a single compound, 6-[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminopropyl]-5,6-dihydro-2,3-dimethoxy-8, 9-methylenedioxy-5,11-dioxo-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline hydrochloride (19a), which proved to be a very potent top1 inhibitor having a 110 nM mean graph midpoint (MGM) when tested for cytotoxicity in 55 human cancer cell cultures. A number of structurally related indenoisoquinolines were also obtained that had both potent cytotoxicity as well as top1 inhibitory activity. The key feature of the more potent compounds was the presence of an aminoalkyl side chain on the indenoisoquinoline nitrogen atom. The DNA cleavage patterns induced by top1 in the presence of the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin. Some of the cleavage sites induced by the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin, and conversely, camptothecin induced unique cleavage sites not apparent with the indenoisoquinolines. However, both camptothecin and the indenoisoquinolines also induced DNA cleavage sites that were the same in both series but varied in intensity. In addition, some of the DNA cleavages seen with the free base of 19a (compound 18c) in the presence of top1 were inhibited at higher drug concentrations, suggesting either a direct inhibition of the enzyme or an alternative mechanism involving DNA intercalation. Consistent with intercalation, compound 18c did unwind DNA.\n",

Abstract: In this paper, we present our results from a docking study of the title compounds with the DNA/topoisomerase I complex based on the recently published X-ray crystal structure of the topotecan/DNA/topoisomerase I ternary cleavable complex (Staker, B.L., et al.

Abstract: 5H-8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxydibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one exhibits potent TOP1-targeting activity and pronounced antitumor activity.

In this study 8-, 9-, and 10-nitro-5H-2,3-methylenedioxy-5-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)dibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one and their amino derivatives were synthesized and assessed for their relative TOP1-targeting activity and cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Homocamptothecin (hCPT) is an E-ring modified camptothecin (CPT) analogue bearing a methylene spacer between the alcohol and carboxyl functions of the CPT lactone. Combining pronounced inhibitory activity of topoisomerase I (Topo I) with enhanced plasma stability, hCPT constitutes an attractive template for the elaboration of new anticancer agents. Fluorinated hCPT analogues, prepared in enantiomerically pure form, were assayed by their stimulation of Topo I-mediated DNA cleavage. Translation into cytotoxicity against tumor cells was evaluated on HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma and on the multidrug resistant lung and bladder tumor cell lines, A549 and T24r. Good correlation is observed between the ability of the drugs to stimulate Topo I-mediated DNA cleavage and the respective 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50) values) of the HT29, A549, and T24r cell growth. Fluorine substitution in the A-ring of hCPT was found to have a pronounced influence on biological activity, providing several compounds which are up to 100-fold more potent than CPT in terms of IC(50). Among these, 10,11-difluoro-hCPT has been selected for further development.\n",

Abstract: Camptothecin (1), a potent antitumor alkaloid, is known to inhibit topoisomerase I, an enzyme that relaxes supercoiled DNA. Modifications have been made to the B, D, and E rings of this natural product. Specifically, compounds 2-10 either have an ester moiety in place of the E ring lactone, a methyl ester attached to position 14, a saturated (or nonexistent) deaza B ring, or contain a combination of these permutations. We have conducted in vitro assays against the topoisomerase I relaxation reaction which verify the necessity for a lactone in the E ring. Furthermore, steric requirements at position 14 are shown to be crucial for activity, and planarity of the A and B rings of camptothecin is also implicated in the ability of the drug to inhibit topoisomerase I. Speculation on the nature of the drug binding pocket is presented.\n",

Abstract: Homocamptothecin (hCPT), a camptothecin (CPT) analogue with a seven membered beta-hydroxylactone which combines enhanced plasma stability and potent topoisomerase I (Topo I)-mediated activity, is an attractive template for the elaboration of new anticancer agents. Like CPT, hCPT carries an asymmetric tertiary alcohol and displays stereoselective inhibition of Topo I. The preparation and biological screening of racemic hCPT analogues are described. The 10 hCPTs tested were better Topo I inhibitors than CPT. Fluorinated hCPTs 23c, d,f,g were found to have potent cytotoxic activity on A427 and PC-3 tumor cell lines. Their cytotoxicity remained high on the K562adr and MCF7mdr cell lines, which overexpress a functionally active P-glycoprotein. Fluorinated hCPTs were more efficacious in vivo than CPT on HT-29 xenografts. In this model, a tumor growth delay of 25 days was reached with hCPT 23g at a daily dose of 0.32 mg/kg, compared to 4 days with CPT at 0.625 mg/kg. Thus difluorinated hCPT 23g warrants further investigation as a novel Topo I inhibitor with high cytotoxicity toward tumor cells and promising in vivo efficacy.\n",

            "Title: Modification of the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin: inhibition of mammalian topoisomerase I and biological activity.  Abstract: Several camptothecin derivatives containing a modified hydroxy lactone ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Each of the groups of the hydroxy lactone moiety, the carbonyl oxygen, the ring lactone oxygen, and the 20-hydroxy group, were shown to be critical for enzyme inhibition. For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex. With a few exceptions, those compounds that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action. One of these compounds was tested for antitumor activity and was found to be inactive. The present findings, as well as other reports that the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin is critical for antitumor activity in vivo, correlate with the structure-activity relationships at the level of topoisomerase I and support the hypothesis that antitumor activity is related to inhibition of this target enzyme.\n",

Abstract: As a part of studies on structure-activity relationships, several potential topoisomerase I inhibitors were prepared. Different analogues of the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group were synthesized. These compounds bore either the sugar residue of rebeccamycin, with or without the chlorine atoms on the indole moieties, or modified sugar residues (galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, or fucopyranosyl) linked to the aglycone via a beta- or alpha-N-glycosidic bond. Their inhibitory properties toward protein kinase C, topoisomerase I, and topoisomerase II were examined, and their DNA-binding properties were investigated. Their in vitro antitumor activities against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells were determined. Their antimicrobial activities were tested against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, and yeast Candida albicans. These compounds are inactive toward topoisomerase II but inhibit topoisomerase I. A substitution with a methyl group on the imide nitrogen led to a loss of proteine kinase C inhibition in the maleimide indolocarbazole series but did not prevent topoisomerase I inhibition. Compounds possessing a beta-N-glycosidic bond, which fully intercalated into DNA, were more efficient at inhibiting topoisomerase I than their analogues with an alpha-N-glycosidic bond; however, both were equally toxic toward P388 leukemia cells. Dechlorinated rebeccamycin possessing a methyl group on the imide nitrogen was about 10 times more efficient in terms of cytotoxicity and inhibition of topoisomerase I than the natural metabolite.\n",

Subsequent aromatization, chlorination, and substitution with (dimethylamino)alkylamines, followed by a demethylation or a selective desisopropylation, allowed us to synthesize the derivatives 6a-i and 7a-h bearing a [(dimethylamino)alkyl]amino side chain at their 6-position. These compounds, as the other analogs 5a-b, were devised to further study the structure-activity relationships in the benzo[c]phenanthridine family of antitumor alkaloids led by fagaronine (1a) and nitidine (1b).

Abstract: A series of 10 indolocarbazole derivatives, analogues to the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin, bearing modifications at the imide heterocycle were synthesized. They bear an N-methyl imide, N-methyl amide, or anhydride function instead of the original imide. Their inhibitory potencies toward topoisomerase I were examined using a DNA relaxation assay and by analyzing the drug-induced cleavage of 32P-labeled DNA. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition and interaction with DNA were also studied together with the in vitro antiproliferative activities against B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. The antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis), a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a yeast (Candida albicans) were tested as well as their antiviral activities toward HIV-1. The efficiency of the anhydride compounds was compared to that of the parent compound rebeccamycin and its dechlorinated analogue. All the compounds studied were inactive against PKC. The structural requirements for PKC and topoisomerase I inhibition are markedly different. In sharp contrast with the structure-PKC inhibition relationships, we found that an anhydride function does not affect topoisomerase I inhibition, whereas a methyl group on the indole nitrogen prevents the poisoning of topoisomerase I. The compounds exhibiting a marked toxicity to P388 leukemia cells had little or no effect on the growth of P388CPT5 cells which are resistant to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. This study reinforces the conclusion that the DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complex is the primary cellular target of the indolocarbazoles and significantly contributes to their cytotoxicity and possibly to their weak but noticeable anti-HIV-1 activities.

Abstract: Terbenzimidazoles poison the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I and possess significant cytotoxic activity against several human tumor cell lines. The relative pharmacological activity of 4,5- and 5,6-benzoterbenzimidazoles was compared to that of 5-phenylterbenzimidazole (3). 5,6-Benzoterbenzimidazole is inactive as a topoisomerase I poison and did not exhibit significant cytotoxic activity. In contrast, 4,5-benzoterbenzimidazole retained activity as a topoisomerase I poison but exhibited weak cytotoxic activity relative to 3. While 5-(1-naphthyl)terbenzimidazole is less potent than 3 as a topoisomerase I poison and cytotoxic agent, 5-(2-naphthyl)-terbenzimidazole has comparable activity to 3. The presence of a p-methoxy or p-chloro substituent on the phenyl moiety did not dramatically alter the pharmacological activity of 3. Several analogs of 3 were synthesized wherein the 2\"-substituent varied from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, phenyl to p-methoxyphenyl. Evaluation of the intrinsic activity of these analogs as topoisomerase I poisons indicates that topoisomerase I poisoning was not diminished by the presence of a methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl substituent at the 2\"-position.

Abstract: The synthesis, characterization, inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I, and biological evaluation of a series of 14 camptothecin derivatives of polypyrrolecarboxamide (lexitropsin) conjugates of two structural classes: (A) camptothecin-NHCO-lexitropsin 44-51 and (B) camptothecin-CONH-lexitropsin 38-43 are described. All 16 compounds tested, 14 conjugates plus two functionalized camptothecin controls, inhibit topoisomerase I in the concentration range 1.12-16.6 microM that divide into three distinct categories based on activity. The most active enzyme inhibitors belong to structure class A with either cationic dimethylaminium or neutral amide end groups. Generally class B conjugates are less effective in inhibiting topoisomerase I. Cytotoxic potencies of the drugs was tested against four representative human tumor cell lines: SKOV3, SKLVB, HT29, and KB. All 16 drugs gave measurable IC50 values against the KB cell line and fell into two categories with IC50 values of 0.049-0.66 microM (largely structure class B) and 1.0-48 microM (largely class A). Thus the class B conjugates, while less potent against the enzyme, contain two of the most potent drugs, 38 and 39, against KB cell lines. In contrast, in the case of the cell lines SKOV3 and HT29 there was a general correlation between the better topoisomerase inhibitors and their cell cytotoxicities.\n",

Abstract: Several 1,2,3-tridemethyldeacetylthiocolchicine derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against various human tumor cell lines and for their inhibitory effects on DNA topoisomerases in vitro. Exhaustive demethylation of thiocolchicine analogues completely changes their biological profiles. Instead of displaying antitubulin activity, most target compounds inhibited topoisomerase II activity. Only compounds with a larger side chain, such as 15a, 23a, and 24a, did not interfere with topoisomerase II enzymatic functions. The cytotoxicity of target compounds was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude compared to that of colchicine in most cell lines. The hydrophilicity of phenolic compounds might prevent drug passage through the cell plasma membrane and, thus, be responsible for the relatively weak cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, 27-30 were prepared from 16a by protecting all hydroxy groups with esters with an aim to facilitate drug transportation. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicated that 27 was more potent than its parent compound in all tested tumor cell lines and showed tissue selective cytotoxicity with a significant inhibitory effect against KB cells (IC50 = 2.7 microg/mL).

Seventeen of the compounds showed cytotoxic effects comparable or superior to those of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) against mouse leukemia P388 and human tumor cell lines HOC-21 and QG-56.

Abstract: Human topoisomerase I (top1) is the molecular target of a diverse set of anticancer compounds, including the camptothecins, indolocarbazoles, and indenoisoquinolines. These compounds bind to a transient top1-DNA covalent complex and inhibit the resealing of a single-strand nick that the enzyme creates to relieve superhelical tension in duplex DNA. (Hertzberg, R. P.; et al. Biochem. 1989, 28, 4629-4638. Hsiang, Y. H.; et al. J. Biol. Chem 1985, 260, 14873-14878. Champoux, J. J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001, 70, 369-413. Stewart, L.; et al. Science 1998, 729, 1534-1541.) We report the X-ray crystal structures of the human top1-DNA complex bound with camptothecin and representative members of the indenoisoquinoline and indolocarbazole classes of top1 poisons. The planar nature of all three structurally diverse classes allows them to intercalate between DNA base pairs at the site of single-strand cleavage. All three classes of compounds have a free electron pair near Arg364, a residue that if mutated confers resistance to all three classes of drugs. The common intercalative binding mode is augmented by unexpected chemotype-specific contacts with amino acid residues Asn352 and Glu356, which adopt alternative side-chain conformations to accommodate the bound compounds. These new X-ray structures explain how very different molecules can stabilize top1-DNA covalent complexes and will aid the rational design of completely novel structural classes of anticancer drugs.\n",

            "Title: Camptothecin analogs with bulky, hydrophobic substituents at the 7-position via a Grignard reaction.  Abstract: By developing a new synthetic procedure for introduction of side chains onto the camptothecin ring system, we were able to achieve the preparation of a number of analogs bearing bulky, hydrophobic groups directly attached to the 7-position. These include 7-tert-butylcamptothecin, 7-benzylcamptothecin and the corresponding 10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecins. This method involves the reaction of an appropriate orthoaminobenzonitrile with various Grignard reagents to give the corresponding orthoaminoketones. Friedlander condensation of the latter with the key tricyclic ketone leads to 7-substituted camptothecin analogs. We report the activity of these compounds as topoisomerase I poisons and their ability to inhibit growth of selected tumor cell lines.\n",

Abstract: An ab initio quantum mechanics calculation is reported which predicts the orientation of indenoisoquinoline 4 in the ternary cleavage complex formed from DNA and topoisomerase I (top1). The results of this calculation are consistent with the hypothetical structures previously proposed for the indenoisoquinoline-DNA-top1 ternary complexes based on molecular modeling, the crystal structure of a recently reported ternary complex, and the biological results obtained with a pair of diaminoalkyl-substituted indenoisoquinoline enantiomers. The results of these studies indicate that the pi-pi stacking interactions between the indenoisoquinolines and the neighboring DNA base pairs play a major role in determining binding orientation. The calculation of the electrostatic potential surface maps of the indenoisoquinolines and the adjacent DNA base pairs shows electrostatic complementarity in the observed binding orientation, leading to the conclusion that electrostatic attraction between the intercalators and the base pairs in the cleavage complex plays a major stabilizing role. On the other hand, the calculation of LUMO and HOMO energies of indenoisoquinoline 13b and neighboring DNA base pairs in conjunction with NBO analysis indicates that charge transfer complex formation plays a relatively minor role in stabilizing the ternary complexes derived from indenoisoquinolines, DNA, and top1.

Abstract: 5H-8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxydibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one (ARC-111) has potent TOP1-targeting activity and pronounced antitumor activity. Several analogues of ARC-111 were synthesized with NH2, N-alkyl, N,N-dialkyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, and piperazinyl substituents at the 2-position of the 5-ethyl group. The relative TOP1-targeting activity and cytotoxicity of these structural analogues were assessed in RPMI8402 and P388 tumor cells and their camptothecin-resistant variants CPT-K5 and P388/CPT45, respectively. Potent TOP1-targeting activity was retained within a series of mono N-alkyl analogues that included NHCH2CH3, NHCH(CH3)2, and NHC(CH3)3. TOP1-targeting activity was diminished by the presence of a N-benzyl moiety. In a comparison of a series of N-alkyl-N-isopropyl analogues, activity decreased in the order CH3 > CH2CH3 > CH(CH3)2. Cytotoxicity in RPMI8402 and P388 did correlate with TOP1-targeting activity. Cytotoxic activity was also determined in KB3-1 cells and its variants KB/V-1 and KBH5.0. As KB/V-1 cells overexpress MDR1 and KBH5.0 cells overexpress BCRP, decreased cytotoxicity in these cell lines relative to the parent cell line is indicative of compounds that are substrates for these efflux transporters. In view of their diminished cytotoxicity in KB/V-1 cells, it appears that the likely demethylated metabolites of ARC-111, i.e., where NH2 or NHCH3 replaces the N(CH3)2 at the 2-position of the 5-ethyl substituent, are substrates for MDR1. In contrast, no significant difference in cytotoxicity among these three cell lines was observed with other N-alkyl analogues, including NHC2H5, NHCH(CH3)2, NHC(CH3)3, N(CH3)2, N(CH2CH3)2, NCH3(CH(CH3)2), and either the pyrrolidinyl or the piperidinyl analogues. The 2-(piperazinyl) analogues were associated with diminished cytotoxicity in KB/V-1 cells, suggesting that the second basic amino substituent is associated with their recognition as substrates by MDR1. Comparative studies on the antitumor activity of ARC-111 and its N-demethylated derivatives (the NHCH3 and NH2 analogues) against SJ-BT45 medulloblastoma xenografts in scid mice revealed that the secondary amine metabolite is at least as active as ARC-111 in vivo, although the primary amine derivative was significantly less potent.\n",

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines represent a class of non-camptothecin topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors that exert cytotoxicity by trapping the covalent complex formed between DNA and Top1 during relaxation of DNA supercoils. As an ongoing evaluation of Top1 inhibition and anticancer activity, indenoisoquinolines were linked via their lactam side chains to provide polyamines end-capped with intercalating motifs. The resulting bisindenoisoquinolines were evaluated for cytotoxicity in the National Cancer Institute's human cancer cell screen and for Top1 inhibition. Preliminary findings suggested that the 2-3-2 and 3-3-3 linkers, referring to the number of carbons between nitrogen atoms, were optimal for both potent Top1 inhibition and cytotoxicity. Using optimized linkers, bisindenoisoquinolines were synthesized with nitro and methoxy substituents on the aromatic rings. The biological results for substituted compounds revealed a disagreement between the structure-activity relationships of monomeric indenoisoquinolines and bisindenoisoquinolines as Top1 inhibitors, but cytotoxicity was maintained for both series of compounds.\n",

Abstract: A number of derivatives of camptothecin with a polyamine chain linked to position 7 of camptothecin via an amino, imino, or oxyiminomethyl group were synthesized and tested for their biological activity. All compounds showed marked growth inhibitory activity against the H460 human lung carcinoma cell line. In particular, the iminomethyl derivatives where the amino groups of the chain were protected with Boc groups exhibited a high potency, with IC50 values of approximately 10(-8) M. The pattern of DNA cleavage in vitro and the persistence of the cleavable ternary complex drug-DNA-topoisomerase I observed with polyamine conjugates containing free amino groups support a contribution of specific drug interaction with DNA as a determinant of activity. Modeling of compound 7c in the complex with topoisomerase 1 and DNA is consistent with this hypothesis. The lack of a specific correlation between stabilization of the cleavable complex and growth inhibition likely reflects multiple factors including the cellular pharmacokinetic behavior related to the variable lipophilicity of the conjugate, and the nature and linkage of the polyamine moiety.\n",

In doing so we adapted the traditional, gramine based approach for tryptophan and tryptamine synthesis. The most potent new compound, 3-(2-aminoethyl)-4,11-dihydroxynaphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-dione (16), was equally cytotoxic (IC(50) within low micromolar concentrations) for human K562 leukemia and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines and their isogenic sublines with genetically defined determinants of altered drug response, that is, the expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein and loss of pro-apoptotic p53. Each of these mechanisms conferred resistance to the reference drug adriamycin. In contrast, naphthotryptamine 16, although less potent than adriamycin, was equally toxic for wild type cell lines and drug resistant counterparts. Moreover, at 3-5 microM 16 inhibited topoisomerase I in vitro. Thus, our novel naphthoindole based derivative of tryptamine gained new activities important for anticancer therapy, namely, suppression of topoisomerase I and the ability to overcome resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein expression and p53 dysfunction.\n",

Abstract: Amonafide (1), a naphthalimide which binds to DNA by intercalation and poisons topoisomerase IIalpha, has demonstrated activity in phase II breast cancer trials, but has failed thus far to enter clinical phase III because of dose-limiting bone marrow toxicity. Compound 17 (one of 41 new compounds synthesized) is a novel anticancer naphthalimide with a distinct mechanism of action, notably inducing autophagy and senescence in cancer cells.

Furthermore, 17 has shown itself to be superior to amonafide in vivo in models of (i) L1210 murine leukemia, (ii) MXT-HI murine mammary adenocarcinoma, and (iii) orthotopic models of human A549 NSCLC and BxPC3 pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Recent data suggest that curcumin, a phytochemical with cancer chemopreventive potential, might be useful in the treatment of several solid and hematological malignancies. DNA topoisomerases (topos) are the target of several drugs commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. These drugs induce topo-DNA complexes with either topo I or topo II; then cellular processing converts these complexes into permanent DNA strand breaks that trigger cell death. Using the TARDIS in vivo assay, this study shows for the first time that curcumin induces topo I and topo II (alpha and beta)-DNA complexes in K562 leukemia cells. A comparative analysis revealed that the levels of these complexes were higher than those induced by several standard topo I and topo II inhibitors at equitoxic doses. Curcumin-induced topo I and topo II-DNA complexes were prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine; this suggests that, unlike the standard topo inhibitors, reactive oxygen species may mediate the formation of these complexes. Overall, this work shows that curcumin is capable of inducing topo-DNA complexes in cells with both topo I and topo II and increases the evidence suggesting that this dietary agent has potential to be tested in cancer chemotherapy.\n",

Compound 2 is a novel rubralactone derivative, 6-hydroxy-8-methoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3a,9b-tetrahydrocyclopenta[c]isochromene-3,5-dione.

Abstract: From ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts of Lethedon tannaensis leaves, which were cytotoxic against murine leukemia (P-388) and human nasopharynx carcinoma (KB) cells, one new and six known 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavones variously substituted on the B ring were isolated and their structures determined by spectral analysis. Compounds active against KB cells were velutin (4) (IC50 4.8 microM), 7,3',5'-tri-O-methyltricetin (2) (IC50 22.2 microM), genkwanin (6) (IC50 30.6 microM), and the novel compound, 7,3',4'-tri-O-methyltricetin, named lethedocin (1) (IC50 47.6 microM). These flavones required the presence of hydroxyl groups at C-5 and C-4' and methoxyl groups at C-7 and C-3' for inhibition of calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I activity.\n",

Abstract: DNA topoisomerases (Topos) are enzymes that play a crucial role in DNA metabolism events such as replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation at mitosis. Thus, Topo inhibitors could be expected to have antitumor effects. Naturally occurring lupane- and oleanane-type triterpenoids isolated from the bark of Phyllanthus flexuosus were screened for human Topos I and II inhibitory activities. Olean-12-en-3 beta,15 alpha-diol (1), olean-12-en-3 beta,15 alpha,24-triol (3), lupeol (4), and betulin (6) were found to be selective catalytic inhibitors of human Topo II activity with IC(50) values in the range of 10-39 microM.\n",

Abstract: The aromathecin or \"rosettacin\" class of topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors is effectively a \"composite\" of the natural products camptothecin and luotonin A and the synthetic indenoisoquinolines. The aromathecins have aroused considerable interest following the isolation and total synthesis of 22-hydroxyacuminatine, a rare cytotoxic natural product containing the 12 H-5,11a-diazadibenzo[ b, h]fluoren-11-one system.

These inhibitors are proposed to act via an intercalation and \"poisoning\" mechanism identical to camptothecin and the indenoisoquinolines. Many of these compounds possess greater antiproliferative activity and anti-top1 activity than the parent unsubstituted compound (rosettacin) and previously synthesized aromathecins, as well as greater top1 inhibitory activity than 22-hydroxyacuminatine. In addition to potentially aiding solubility and localization to the DNA-enzyme complex, nitrogenous substituents located at the 14-position of the aromathecin system have been proposed to project into the major groove of the top1-DNA complex and hydrogen-bond to major-groove amino acids, thereby stabilizing the ternary complex.\n",

Extracts identified by this process were further characterized by a selective yeast bioassay for inhibitors of topoisomerase I and by a biochemical assay for compounds that stabilize the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent binary complex. Five of the extracts were positive in the yeast bioassay, and eight extracts showed activity on the assay that monitors stabilization of the topoisomerase I-DNA complex. Four of the latter extracts were inactive in the yeast bioassay, and thus would not have been identified as hits without the COMPARE preselection process.

On the other hand, compounds 1 and 2 did not influence the activities of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is a pol of family X, and the other families of eukaryotic pols, such as family A (i.e., pol gamma), family B (i.e., pols alpha, delta, and epsilon) and family Y (i.e., pols eta, iota, and kappa), and showed no effect even on the activities of plant pol alpha, fish pol delta, prokaryotic pols, and other DNA metabolic enzymes, such as calf primase of pol alpha, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, human telomerase, T7 RNA polymerase, mouse inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (type II), human topoisomerases I and II, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and bovine deoxyribonuclease I. The results suggested that these novel compounds could identify the inhibition between pols beta, lambda, and TdT in family X.\n",

Abstract: We developed the synthesis of a series of thiophene-fused tetracyclic analogues of the antitumor drug ametantrone. The reactions included nucleophilic substitution of methoxy groups in 4,11-dimethoxyanthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-diones with ethylenediamines, producing the derivatives of 4,11-diaminoanthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione in good yields. Several compounds showed marked antiproliferative potency against doxorubicin-selected, P-glycoprotein-expressing tumor cells and p53(-/-) cells. The cytotoxicity of some novel compounds for P-glycoprotein-positive cells is highly dependent on N-substituent at the terminal amino group of ethylenediamine moiety. The cytotoxic potency of selected compounds correlated with their ability to attenuate the functions of topoisomerase I and telomerase, strongly suggesting that these enzymes are the major targets of antitumor activity of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione derivatives.\n",

Abstract: Penicilliols A (1) and B (2) are novel 5-methoxy-3(2H)-furanones isolated from cultures of a fungus (Penicillium daleae K.M. Zalessky) derived from a sea moss, and their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. These compounds selectively inhibited activities of eukaryotic Y-family DNA polymerases (pols) (i.e., pols eta, iota and kappa), and compound 1 was a stronger inhibitor than compound 2. Among mammalian Y-family pols, mouse pol iota activity was most strongly inhibited by compounds 1 and 2, with IC(50) values of 19.8 and 32.5 microM, respectively. On the other hand, activities of many other pols, such as A-family (i.e., pol gamma), B-family (i.e., pols alpha, delta and epsilon) or X-family (i.e., pols beta, lambda and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase), and some DNA metabolic enzymes, such as calf primase of pol alpha, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, human telomerase, T7 RNA polymerase, mouse IMP dehydrogenase (type II), human topoisomerases I and II, T4 polynucleotide kinase or bovine deoxyribonuclease I, are not influenced by these compounds.

The ITC and Topo I assay studies suggested that the 9-substituent has a strong impact on binding modes ranging from an apparent preference for intercalation with a 9-2-thienyl substituent (similar binding to [poly(dCdG)](2) and [poly(dAdT)](2), re-supercoiling of DNA in the Topo I assay at <10(-5)M dye), to mixed binding modes with 9-phenyl derivatives (2- to 3-fold preference for binding to [poly(dAdT)](2), re-supercoiling of DNA in the Topo I assay at approximately 2 x 10(-5)M dye), to minor groove binding in a 9-(2-thienyl-5-diethylcarboxamide) derivative (strong preference for binding to [poly(dAdT)](2), did not show complete re-supercoiling in the Topo I assay).

Abstract: The aromathecin topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors offer promising scaffolds for the development of novel cancer chemotherapeutics. They are 'composites' of the camptothecin and indenoisoquinoline top1 inhibitors. Interestingly, some structure-activity relationship (SAR) overlap between the aromathecins and the indenoisoquinolines has been observed. For both classes, placement of certain polar groups in similar regions of the heteroaromatic system improves top1 inhibitory and antiproliferative activities. A series of water-soluble aromathecins substituted at position 14 with diaminoalkanes of various lengths has been prepared. These compounds all possess similar antiproliferative potency, but a general trend is observed: aromathecins with longer diaminoalkane substituents (>6 carbons) possess lower anti-top1 activity than their smaller counterparts (2-4 carbons), presumably as a result of unfavorable hydrophobic interactions. This trend is also noted with the indenoisoquinolines, revealing additional SAR overlap that supports the hypothesis that there is a 'universal' top1 inhibitor SAR.\n",

Abstract: The present report describes the synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of certain indolo[3,2-c]quinoline derivatives. For the C(6) anilino-substituted derivatives, (11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-yl)phenylamine (6a) was inactive. Structural optimization of 6a by the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the anilino-moiety resulted in the enhancement of antiproliferative activity in which the activity decreased in an order of para-OH, 7a>meta-OH, 8a>ortho-OH, 9a. For the C(6) alkylamino-substituted derivatives, 11a, 12a, 13a, 14a, and 15a exhibited comparable antiproliferative activities against all cancer cells tested and the skin Detroit 551 normal fibroblast cells. Three cancer cells, HeLa, A549, and SKHep, are very susceptible with IC(50) of less than 2.17 microM while PC-3 is relatively resistant to this group of indolo[3,2-c]quinolines. For the 2-phenylethylamino derivatives, compound 20a is active against the growth of HeLa with an IC(50) of 0.52 microM, but is less effective against the growth of Detroit 551 with an IC(50) of 19.32 microM. For the bis-indolo[3,2-c]quinolines, N,N-bis-[3-(11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-yl)aminopropyl]amine hydrochloride (25) is more active than its N-methyl derivative 26 and the positive Doxorubicin. Mechanism studies indicated 25 can induce caspase-3 activation, gamma-H2AX phosphorylation, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and DNA fragmentation. These results provide evidence that DNA, topo I, and topo II are the primary targets of indolo[3,2-c]quinoline derivatives and that consequently inhibits proliferation and causes apoptosis in cancer cells.\n",

Abstract: Chemical transformation studies were conducted on betulinic acid (1), a common plant-derived lupane-type triterpene. Eleven new rationally designed derivatives of 1 (2-5 and 7-13) were synthesized based on docking studies and tested for their topoisomerase I and IIalpha inhibitory activity. Semisynthetic reactions targeted C-3, C-20, and C-28 in 1. Structures of the new compounds were confirmed by spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D NMR and MS). Compound 9, 3-O-[N-(phenylsulfonyl)carbamoyl-17beta-N-(phenylsulfonyl)amide]betulinic acid, showed 1.5-fold the activity of CPT in a topoisomerase I DNA relaxation assay. Four out of 14 betulinic acid analogues (5, 9, 11, and 12) showed 1.5-fold the activity of etoposide in a topoisomerase II assay. The new analogues exhibited better cytotoxic activities against the human colon cancer cells SW948 and HCT-116 and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared to the parent (1). Betulinic acid (1) is a potential scaffold for the design of new topoisomerase I and IIalpha inhibitors.\n",

Abstract: Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3'-phosphotyrosyl bonds. Such linkages form in vivo when topoisomerase I (Top1) processes DNA. For this reason, Tdp1 has been implicated in the repair of irreversible Top1-DNA covalent complexes. Tdp1 inhibitors have been regarded as potential therapeutics in combination with Top1 inhibitors, such as the camptothecin derivatives, topotecan, and irinotecan, which are used to treat human cancers. Using a novel high-throughput screening assay, we have identified the C21-substituted progesterone derivative, NSC 88915 (1), as a potential Tdp1 inhibitor. Secondary screening and cross-reactivity studies with related DNA processing enzymes confirmed that compound 1 possesses specific Tdp1 inhibitory activity. Deconstruction of compound 1 into discrete functional groups reveals that both components are required for inhibition of Tdp1 activity. Moreover, the synthesis of analogues of compound 1 has provided insight into the structural requirements for the inhibition of Tdp1. Surface plasmon resonance shows that compound 1 binds to Tdp1, whereas an inactive analogue fails to interact with the enzyme. On the basis of molecular docking and mechanistic studies, we propose that these compounds are competitive inhibitors, which mimics the oligonucleotide-peptide Tdp1 substrate. These steroid derivatives represent a novel chemotype and provide a new scaffold for developing small molecule inhibitors of Tdp1.\n",

Abstract: A series of novel thiosemicarbazone derivatives bearing condensed heterocyclic carboxaldehyde moieties were designed and synthesized. Among them, TSC24 exhibited broad antiproliferative activity in a panel of human tumor cells and suppressed tumor growth in mice. The mechanism research revealed that TSC24 was not only an iron chelator but also a topoisomerase IIalpha catalytic inhibitor. Its inhibition on topoisomerase IIalpha was due to direct interaction with the ATPase domain of topoisomerase IIalpha which led to the block of ATP hydrolysis. Molecular docking predicted that TSC24 might bind at the ATP binding site, which was confirmed by the competitive inhibition assay. These results about the mechanisms involved in the anticancer activities of thiosemicarbazones will aid in the rational design of novel topoisomerase II-targeted drugs and will provide insights into the discovery and development of novel cancer therapeutics based on the dual activity to chelate iron and to inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIalpha.\n",

Sixteen cytotoxic aesculiosides isolated from Aesculus pavia inhibited TOP1 catalytic activity by interacting directly with the free enzyme and preventing the formation of the DNA-TOP1 complex. Interestingly, hydrolysis of six active aesculiosides (1, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 23) lost their TOP1 activities but enhanced their cytotoxicities. None of the test compounds showed any activity against TOP2. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigations indicated that cytotoxic oleananes required at least one angeloyl moiety at either C-21 or C-22 but the sugar moiety at C-3 may decrease their cytotoxicities. An angeloyl or tigeloyl group at C-21 is required for oleananes to bind the free TOP1 enzyme although the type and length of acyl moiety at C-22 also affects their activity. However, sugar moiety at C-3 is necessary for their TOP1 activities.\n",

Abstract: Tryptanthrins have potential therapeutic activity against a wide variety of pathogenic organisms, although little is known about their mechanism. Activity against Escherichia coli, however, has not been examined. The effects of tryptanthrin (indolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-6,12-dione) and nine derivatives on growth, survival, and mutagenesis in E. coli were examined. Analogues with a nitrogen atom at the 4-position of tryptanthrin stopped log phase growth of E. coli cultures at concentrations as low as 5 microM. Tryptanthrins decreased viability during incubation with cells in buffer by factors of 10(-2) to <10(-6) at 0.2-40 microM. Derivatives with an oxime group at the 6-position exhibited the greatest bactericidal activity. Most tryptanthrins were not mutagenic in several independent assays, although the 4-aza and 4 aza-8-fluoro derivatives increased frameshift mutations about 22- and 4-fold, respectively. Given the structure of trypanthrins, binding to DNA may occur by intercalation. From analysis using a sensitive linking number assay, several tryptanthrins, especially the 4-aza and 6-oximo derivatives, intercalate into DNA.\n",

            "Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel series of anthrapyrazoles linked with netropsin-like oligopyrrole carboxamides as anticancer agents.  Abstract: Anticancer drugs that bind to DNA and inhibit DNA-processing enzymes represent an important class of anticancer drugs. Combilexin molecules, which combine DNA minor groove binding and intercalating functionalities, have the potential for increased DNA binding affinity and increased selectivity due to their dual mode of DNA binding. This study describes the synthesis of DNA minor groove binder netropsin analogs containing either one or two N-methylpyrrole carboxamide groups linked to DNA-intercalating anthrapyrazoles. Those hybrid molecules which had both two N-methylpyrrole groups and terminal (dimethylamino)alkyl side chains displayed submicromolar cytotoxicity towards K562 human leukemia cells. The combilexins were also evaluated for DNA binding by measuring the increase in DNA melting temperature, for DNA topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated double strand cleavage of DNA, for inhibition of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha decatenation activity, and for inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I relaxation of DNA. Several of the compounds stabilized the DNA-topoisomerase IIalpha covalent complex indicating that they acted as topoisomerase IIalpha poisons. Some of the combilexins had higher affinity for DNA than their parent anthrapyrazoles. In conclusion, a novel group of compounds combining DNA intercalating anthrapyrazole groups and minor groove binding netropsin analogs have been designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated as possible novel anticancer agents.\n",

All of the pyridine salt derivatives (7-16) revealed comparable or superior topo I inhibitory activity in relation to CPT.

Abstract: Aromathecins are inhibitors of human topoisomerase I (Top1). These compounds are composites of several heteroaromatic systems, namely the camptothecins and indenoisoquinolines, and they possess notable Top1 inhibition and cytotoxicity when substituted at position 14. The SAR of these compounds overlaps with indenoisoquinolines, suggesting that they may intercalate into the Top1-DNA complex similarly. Nonetheless, the proposed binding mode for aromathecins is purely hypothetical, as an X-ray structure is unavailable. In the present communication, we have synthesized eight novel series of A-ring-substituted (positions 1-3) aromathecins, through a simple, modular route, as part of a comprehensive SAR study. Certain groups (such as 2,3-ethylenedioxy) moderately improve Top1 inhibition, and, often, antiproliferative activity, whereas other groups (2,3-dimethoxy and 3-substituents) attenuate bioactivity. Strikingly, these trends are very similar to those previously observed for the A-ring of camptothecins, and this considerable SAR overlap lends further support (in the absence of crystallographic data) to the hypothesis that aromathecins bind in the Top1 cleavage complex as interfacial inhibitors in a 'camptothecin-like' pose.\n",

Several compounds showed better in vitro cytotoxicity and selectivity against MCF-7 cells than daunomycin and doxorubicin, two known DNA binding agents that are clinically-used anti-cancer agents. Although the selectivity for HT 29 and HepG2/C3A cells is generally lower, the IC(50) values of some analogs against these two cancer cell lines were of the same magnitude as doxorubicin.

            "Title: 3-Arylisoquinolines as novel topoisomerase I inhibitors.  Abstract: Topoisomerase I (topo I) is an essential enzyme for vital cellular processes. Inhibition of topo I activities is lethal and leads to cell death, thus establishing topo I as a promising target for cancer treatment. Camptothecin, a natural alkaloid, inhibits topo I. Topotecan and irinotecan, synthetic derivatives of camptothecin, are the most potent anticancer drugs in clinical use. However, several limitations of camptothecins such as solubility, toxicity, stability, resistance and the required high drug dose have encouraged the development of non-camptothecin topo I inhibitors. Natural alkaloid benzo[c]phenanthridines and synthetic indenoisoquinolines have been extensively studied as alternatives to camptothecin. Interestingly, these non-camptothecin topo I inhibitors share a common 3-arylisoquinoline scaffold. This review will describe the development of novel indeno[1,2-c]isoquinolines, isoindolo[2,1-b]isoquinolines, 12-oxobenzo[c]phenanthridines and benz[b]oxepines with a 3-arylisoquinoline nucleus as topo I inhibitors.\n",

Of the compounds prepared compound 25 showed comparable or better cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines tested. Compound 25 inhibited MCF7 (IC(50): 0.49 ± 0.21 μM) and HCT15 (IC(50): 0.23 ± 0.02 μM) carcinoma cell growth more efficiently than references. In the topoisomerases inhibition test, all the compounds were inactive to topoisomerase I but moderate inhibitors to topoisomerase II enzyme. Especially, compound 25 inhibited topoisomerase II activity with comparable extent to etoposide at 100 μM concentrations. Correlation between cytotoxicity and topoisomerase II inhibitory activity implies that compound 25 can be a possible lead compound for anticancer drug impeding the topoisomerase II function.\n",

Abstract: We have reported the preparation and anticancer evaluation of certain 4-anilinofuro[2,3-b]quinolines. However, drawbacks such as lack of selective cytotoxicity, poor oral bioavailability, and poor water solubility exhibited by these compounds prompted us to search for newer derivatives. Among them, (E)-1-(4-(furo[2,3-b]quinolin-4-ylamino)phenyl)ethanone O-2-aminoethyloxime (13a) is selectively active against the growth of NCI-H460 and is highly water-soluble (63 μg/mL). Its hydrochloride salt, 13a·HCl exhibited not only excellent water solubility (1049 μg/mL) but also a high oral bioavailability (57.1%). Compound 13a may cause cancer cell apoptosis through inducing mitotic arrest and mitotic catastrophe mechanism. Xenographic studies indicated the tumor size with 13a·HCl treated nude mice was significantly lower than control. Further evaluation in an orthotopic lung cancer model indicated that 13a·HCl can be absorbed readily through oral administration, distributed to lung tissue, and exhibited significant efficacy in inhibiting the growth of lung cancers.\n",

Abstract: The DNA-relaxing enzyme topoisomerase I (Top1) can be inhibited by heterocyclic compounds such as indolocarbazoles and indenoisoquinolines. Carbohydrate and hydroxyl-containing side chains are essential for the biological activity of indolocarbazoles. The current study investigated how similar functionalities could be \"translated\" to the indenoisoquinoline system and how stereochemistry and hydrogen bonding affect biological activity. Herein is described the preparation and assay of indenoisoquinolines substituted with short-chain alcohols, diols, and carbohydrates. Several compounds (including those derived from sugars) display potent Top1 poisoning and antiproliferative activities. The Top1 poisoning activity of diol-substituted indenoisoquinolines is dependent upon stereochemistry. Although the effect is striking, molecular modeling and docking studies do not indicate any reason for the difference in activity due to similar calculated interactions between the ligand and Top1-DNA complex and ambiguity about the binding mode. A stereochemical dependence was also observed for carbohydrate-derived indenoisoquinolines. Although similar trends were observed in other classes of Top1 inhibitors, the exact nature of this effect has yet to be elucidated.\n",

Among the compounds, 6b bearing bromoacetyl side-chain afforded a potential effect against four human tumor cell lines (liver, colon, breast, and lung). The mechanism of action of 6b is to inhibit the activity of DNA topoisomerase I, followed by the S-phase arrest and then cause apoptotic cell death, similar to that of its parent 1.

Abstract: A series of 7-azaindenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors have been prepared to investigate the effect of increased electron affinity of the aromatic system on the ability to stabilize the Top1-DNA cleavage complex. Ab initio calculations suggest that introduction of nitrogen into the aromatic system of the indenoisoquinolines would facilitate charge transfer complex formation with DNA, thus improving the π-π stacking interactions. The present study shows that 7-azaindenoisoquinolines demonstrate improved water solubility without any decrease in Top1 inhibitory activity or cytotoxicity. Analysis of the biological results reveals that smaller lactam ring substituents enable intercalation into both free DNA and Top1-DNA cleavage complex, whereas larger substituents only allow binding to the cleavage complex but not free DNA. Free DNA binding suppresses Top1-catalyzed DNA cleavage at high drug concentrations, whereas DNA cleavage and inhibition of religation occurs at low drug concentration.\n",

The present study shows that 7-azaindenoisoquinolines demonstrate improved water solubility without any decrease in Top1 inhibitory activity or cytotoxicity. Analysis of the biological results reveals that smaller lactam ring substituents enable intercalation into both free DNA and Top1-DNA cleavage complex, whereas larger substituents only allow binding to the cleavage complex but not free DNA. Free DNA binding suppresses Top1-catalyzed DNA cleavage at high drug concentrations, whereas DNA cleavage and inhibition of religation occurs at low drug concentration.\n",

            "An essential step in the pathogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers is the dysregulated expression of the viral oncogenes. The papillomavirus E2 protein can silence the long control region (LCR) promoter that controls viral E6 and E7 oncogene expression. The mechanisms by which E2 represses oncogene expression and the cellular factors through which E2 mediates this silencing are largely unknown. We conducted an unbiased, genome-wide siRNA screen and series of secondary screens that identified 96 cellular genes that contribute to the repression of the HPV18 LCR. In addition to confirming a role for the E2-binding bromodomain protein Brd4 in E2-mediated silencing, we identified a number of genes that have not previously been implicated in E2 repression, including the demethylase JARID1C/SMCX as well as EP400, a component of the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex. Each of these genes contributes independently and additively to E2-mediated silencing, indicating that E2 functions through several distinct cellular complexes to repress E6 and E7 expression.  This screen was conducted in the lab of Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School) at the ICCB-Longwood Screening Facility, Harvard Medical School.\n",

            "Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of bisintercalating DNA-binding piperazine-linked bisanthrapyrazole compounds as anticancer agents.  Abstract: A series of bisintercalating DNA binding bisanthrapyrazole compounds containing piperazine linkers were designed by molecular modeling and docking techniques. Because the anthrapyrazoles are not quinones they are unable to be reductively activated like doxorubicin and other anthracyclines and thus they should not be cardiotoxic. The concentration dependent increase in DNA melting temperature was used to determine the strength of DNA binding and the bisintercalation potential of the compounds. Compounds with more than a three-carbon linker that could span four DNA base pairs achieved bisintercalation. All of the bisanthrapyrazoles inhibited human erythroleukemic K562 cell growth in the low to submicromolar concentration range. They also strongly inhibited the decatenation activity of topoisomerase IIα and the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I. However, as measured by their ability to induce double strand breaks in plasmid DNA, the bisanthrapyrazole compounds did not act as topoisomerase IIα poisons. In conclusion, a novel group of bisanthrapyrazole compounds were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as potential anticancer agents.\n",

They were evaluated for topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, and cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines for the development of novel anticancer agents. Generally, dihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines exhibited stronger topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, and cytotoxicity compared to those of monohydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines. The concrete structure-activity relationship was observed that dihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines with hydroxyl group at meta or para position of 2-phenyl ring displayed significant topoisomerase II inhibitory activity as well as cytotoxicity.

            "High-content genome-wide RNAi screens identify regulators of parkin upstream of mitophagy  An increasing body of evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (1).  Recent studies of the PD-associated genes PINK12 and PARK2 (Parkin) (3) suggest that they may act in a quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria (4-7).  Following the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the kinase Pink1 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin coordinate a rapid proteasomal (8) and autophagic (mitophagy) (6) response that may attenuate cell death (9-11).  Given that enhanced mitophagy may ameliorate the deleterious consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction (12-14), we hypothesized that genes regulating Parkin translocation would be useful drug targets for increasing mitochondrial quality control.  However, the mechanism of Parkin recruitment following Pink1 accumulation on the outer mitochondrial membrane is too poorly understood to target, and may involve a host of coordinated events.  To identify genes important for the Pink1-dependent recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria, we conducted two diverse genome-wide siRNA screens with high-throughput automation.  Our screening approach took advantage of the well-characterized phenotype of Parkin accumulation on depolarized mitochondria in cells (6).  Cells stably expressing GFP-Parkin and a mitochondrial-targeted red fluorescent protein were transfected with siRNA duplexes in 384-well plates.  After a 48 hour siRNA knockdown, the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to each well to induce rapid mitochondrial depolarization.  Following bulk mitochondrial depolarization in all cells within each well, GFP-Parkin translocation to the damaged mitochondria was allowed to progress for 2.5 hours and then cells were fixed.  The degree of Parkin translocation to the mitochondria of each cell was assessed by high-content analysis.  Primary screening yielded gene candidates involved in an array of diverse cellular processes that were validated in confirmatory assays.        References: 1.) Schapira, A. H. & Tolosa, E.

In this study, novel (dihydro)imidazo[1,6] and [1,7]naphthyridi(no)nes were prepared including pseudo-pentacycles. All the compounds synthesized were screened against four tumor cell lines. Compounds 3(b-d) showed significant in vitro cytotoxicity, and DNA intercalation properties were demonstrated at 25 μM. Imidazonaphthyridinones exhibited no DNA binding affinity despite significant growth inhibition activity. Interestingly, when a pyridinone pharmacophore was linked to the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine scaffold, the geometric orientation of the link had a strong impact on the growth inhibition activity. From these results we conclude that the moderate cytotoxicity observed for these compounds is independent of their DNA-binding and topoisomerase inhibition activities.\n",

Abstract: Substances with dual tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I-topoisomerase I inhibitory activity in one low molecular weight compound would constitute a unique class of anticancer agents that could potentially have significant advantages over drugs that work against the individual enzymes. The present study demonstrates the successful synthesis and evaluation of the first dual Top1-Tdp1 inhibitors, which are based on the indenoisoquinoline chemotype. One bis(indenoisoquinoline) had significant activity against human Tdp1 (IC(50) = 1.52 ± 0.05 μM), and it was also equipotent to camptothecin as a Top1 inhibitor. Significant insights into enzyme-drug interactions were gained via structure-activity relationship studies of the series. The present results also document the failure of the previously reported sulfonyl ester pharmacophore to confer Tdp1 inhibition in this indenoisoquinoline class of inhibitors even though it was demonstrated to work well for the steroid NSC 88915 (7). The current study will facilitate future efforts to optimize dual Top1-Tdp1 inhibitors.\n",

Abstract: Two conjugates (1 and 2) of camptothecin (CPT) and 4β-anilino-4'-O-demethylepipodophyllotoxin were previously shown to exert antitumor activity through inhibition of topoisomerase I (topo I). In this current study, two novel conjugates (1E and 2E) with an open E-ring in the CPT moiety were first synthesized and evaluated for biological activity in comparison with their intact E-ring congeners. This novel class of CPT-derivatives exhibits its antitumor effect against CPT-sensitive and -resistant cells, in part, by inhibiting topo I-linked DNA (TLD) religation. An intact E-ring was not essential for the inhibition of TLD religation, although conjugates with an open E-ring were less potent than the closed ring analogs. This lower religation potency resulted in decreased formation of protein-linked DNA breaks (PLDBs), and hence, less cell growth inhibition. In addition to their impact on topo I, conjugates 1E, 2, and 2E exhibited a minor inhibitory effect on topo II-induced DNA cleavage.

The novel structures of 1E and 2E may present scaffolds for further development of dual function topo I and II inhibitors with improved pharmacological profiles and physicochemical properties.\n",

Abstract: A series of 3,6-bis(3-alkylguanidino) acridines was prepared and the interaction of these novel compounds with calf thymus DNA was investigated with UV-vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, in addition to DNA melting techniques. The binding constants K were estimated to range from 1.25 to 5.26 × 10(5) M(-1), and the percentage of hypochromism was found to be 17-42% (from spectral titration). UV-vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements indicated that the compounds act as effective DNA-intercalating agents. Electrophoretic separation proved that ligands 6a-e relaxed topoisomerase I at a concentration of 60 μM, although only those with longer alkyl chains were able to penetrate cell membranes and suppress cell proliferation effectively. The biological activity of novel compounds was assessed using different techniques (cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential) and demonstrated mostly transient cytostatic action of the ethyl 6c and pentyl 6d derivatives.

Abstract: Hydroxylated analogues of the anticancer topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors indotecan (LMP400) and indimitecan (LMP776) have been prepared because (1) a variety of potent Top1 poisons are known that contain strategically placed hydroxyl groups, which provides a clear rationale for incorporating them in the present case, and (2) the hydroxylated compounds could conceivably serve as synthetic standards for the identification of metabolites. Indeed, incubating LMP400 and LMP776 with human liver microsomes resulted in two major metabolites of each drug, which had HPLC retention times and mass fragmentation patterns identical to those of the synthetic standards. The hydroxylated indotecan and indimitecan metabolites and analogues were tested as Top1 poisons and for antiproliferative activity in a variety of human cancer cell cultures and in general were found to be very potent. Differences in activity resulting from the placement of the hydroxyl group are explained by molecular modeling analyses.\n",

This review compiles the most relevant lanostanoids studied from 2000 to 2011, principally those isolated from Ganoderma lucidum and other related fungi, such as Poria cocos, Laetiporus sulphureus, Inonotus obliquus, Antrodia camphorata, Daedalea dickinsii, and Elfvingia applanata, which have great potential as anticancer agents because of their cytotoxic or apoptotic effects. The compounds were selected on the basis of their proapoptotic mechanisms, through their ability to modify transcriptional activities via nuclear factors or genes and the activation or inhibition of pro- or antiapoptotic proteins; studies based only on their cytotoxicity were excluded from this review in the absence of complementary studies on their mechanisms of action. A total of 81 compounds from Ganoderma lucidum and other species from this genus are included, as well as 96 compounds isolated from other fungi, principally Poria cocos. Some of these compounds were found to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase, increase levels of p53 and Bax, or inhibit the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Other lanostanes have inhibitory effects on the growth of androgen prostate carcinoma through increasing the expression of p21, which activates the tumor suppressor protein p53, while other compounds have been shown to selectively inhibit topo II activity without affecting topo I.

            "Title: Recent advances in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 inhibitors.  Abstract: Tumor hypoxia has been recognized as a common feature of solid tumors and a negative prognostic factor for response to treatment and survival of cancer patients. The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a molecular determinant of responses to hypoxia in mammalian cells, has renewed enthusiasm for discovery and development of targeted therapies exploiting the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. HIF-1 activity in tumors depends on availability of the HIF-1α subunit, the levels of which increase under hypoxic conditions and through activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.

Abstract: Tumor hypoxia has been recognized as a common feature of solid tumors and a negative prognostic factor for response to treatment and survival of cancer patients. The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a molecular determinant of responses to hypoxia in mammalian cells, has renewed enthusiasm for discovery and development of targeted therapies exploiting the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. HIF-1 activity in tumors depends on availability of the HIF-1α subunit, the levels of which increase under hypoxic conditions and through activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Increased HIF-1 has been correlated with increased angiogenesis, aggressive tumor growth, and poor patient prognosis, leading to current interest in HIF-1 as promising anticancer drug target. In spite of an ever increasing number of putative small molecule inhibitors of HIF-1, only a few are progressing through preclinical and early clinical development.

            "Title: Break-induced replication repair of damaged forks induces genomic duplications in human cells  Abstract: In budding yeast, one-ended DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and damaged replication forks are repaired by break-induced replication (BIR), a homologous recombination pathway that requires the Pol32 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. DNA replication stress is prevalent in cancer, but BIR has not been characterized in mammals. In a cyclin E overexpression model of DNA replication stress, POLD3, the human ortholog of POL32, was required for cell cycle progression and processive DNA synthesis. Segmental genomic duplications induced by cyclin E overexpression were also dependent on POLD3, as were BIR-mediated recombination events captured with a specialized DSB repair assay. We propose that BIR repairs damaged replication forks in mammals, accounting for the high frequency of genomic duplications in human cancers.  This RNAi screen aimed to identify genes whose functional inhibition would sensitize U-2 OS cells overexpressing cyclin-E (CCNE1) to oncogene induced DNA replication stress.\n",

Abstract: In order to diversify the pharmacological activity of chalcones and extend the scaffold of topoisomerase and cathepsins B and L inhibitors, we have designed and synthesized total 18 chalcone compounds and tested their biological activity. In the topoisomerase inhibition test, most analogues in group III and IV except compound 11 exhibited more efficient topoisomerase I inhibitory activity than camptothecin at 20 μM.

            "Title: Selective inhibition of bacterial and human topoisomerases by N-arylacyl O-sulfonated aminoglycoside derivatives.  Abstract: Numerous therapeutic applications have been proposed for molecules that bind heparin-binding proteins. Development of such compounds has primarily focused on optimizing the degree and orientation of anionic groups on a scaffold, but utility of these polyanions has been diminished by their typically large size and non-specific interactions with many proteins. In this study N-arylacyl O-sulfonated aminoglycosides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to selectively inhibit structurally similar bacterial and human topoisomerases. It is demonstrated that the structure of the aminoglycoside and of the N-arylacyl moiety imparts selective inhibition of different topoisomerases and alters mechanism. The results here outline a strategy that will be applicable to identifying small, structurally defined oligosaccharides that bind heparin-binding proteins with a high degree of selectivity.\n",

Abstract: Current chemotherapy regimens are comprised mostly of single-target drugs which are often plagued by toxic side effects and resistance development. A pharmacological strategy for circumventing these drawbacks could involve designing multivalent ligands that can modulate multiple targets while avoiding the toxicity of a single-targeted agent. Two attractive targets, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and topoisomerase I (Topo I), are cellular modulators that can broadly arrest cancer proliferation through a range of downstream effects. Both are clinically validated targets with multiple inhibitors in therapeutic use. We describe herein the design and synthesis of dual-acting histone deacetylase-topoisomerase I inhibitors. We also show that these dual-acting agents retain activity against HDAC and Topo I, and potently arrest cancer proliferation.\n",

McMurry coupling reaction was used as the key synthetic step in the preparation of these analogues and the structural assignment of E, Z isomers was determined on the basis of 2D-NOESY experiments. The compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity on breast cancer (MCF-7), cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and biphasic mesothelioma (MSTO-211H) human tumor cell lines. The estrogen like properties of the novel compounds were compared with those of the untreated controls using an estrogen responsive element-based (ERE) luciferase reporter assay and compared to 17β-estradiol (E2). Finally, with the aim to correlate the antiproliferative activity with an intracellular target(s), the effect on relaxation activity of DNA topoisomerases I and II was assayed.\n",

Abstract: Acridine derivatives have been explored as DNA-binding anticancer agents. Some derivatives show undesired pharmacokinetic properties and new derivatives need to be explored. In this work, a series of novel acridine analogues were synthesized by modifying previously unexplored linkers between the acridine and benzene groups and their antiproliferative activity and the DNA-binding ability were evaluated. Among these derivatives, compound 5c demonstrated DNA-binding capability and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. In K562 cell lines, 5c induced apoptosis through mitochondria-dependent intrinsic pathways. These data suggested that compound 5c and other acridine derivatives with modified linkers between the acridine and benzene groups might be potent DNA-binding agents.\n",

Abstract: Semisynthetic reactions were conducted on oleanolic acid, a common plant-derived oleanane-type triterpene. Ten rationally designed derivatives of oleanolic acid were synthesized based on docking studies and tested for their topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activity. Semisynthetic reactions targeted C-3, C-12, C-13, and C-17. Nine of the synthesized compounds were identified as new compounds. The structures of these compounds were confirmed by spectroscopic methods (1D, 2D NMR and MS). Five oleanolic acid analogues (S2, S3, S5, S7 and S9) showed higher activity than camptothecin (CPT) in the topoisomerase I DNA relaxation assay. Four oleanolic acid analogues (S2, S3, S5 and S6) showed higher activity than etoposide in a topoisomerase II assay. The results indicated that the C12-C13 double bond of the oleanolic acid skeleton is important for the inhibitory activity against both types of topoisomerases, while insertion of a longer chain at either position 3 or 17 increases the activity against topoisomerases by various degrees.

Abstract: A series of new anilides (2a-c, 4-7, 17a-c, 18) and quinolones (3a-b, 8a-b, 9a-b, 10-15, 19) with nitrogen-bearing substituents from benzo[b]thiophene and thieno[2,3-c]thiophene series are prepared. Benzo[b]thieno[2,3-c]- and thieno[3',2':4,5]thieno[2,3-c]quinolones (3a-b, 8a-b) are synthesized by the reaction of photochemical dehydrohalogenation from corresponding anilides. Anilides and quinolones were tested for the antiproliferative activity. Fused quinolones bearing protonated aminium group, quaternary ammonium group, N-methylated and protonated aminium group, amino and protonated amino group (8a, 9b, 10-12) showed very prominent anticancer activity, whereby the hydrochloride salt of N',N'-dimethylaminopropyl-substituted quinolone (14) was the most active one, having the IC50 concentration at submicromolar range in accordance with previous QSAR predictions. On the other hand, flexible anilides were among the less active. Chemometric analysis of investigated compounds was performed. 3D-derived QSAR analysis identified solubility, metabolitic stability and the possibility of the compound to be ionized at pH 4-8 as molecular properties that are positively correlated with anticancer activity of investigated compounds, while molecular flexibility, polarizability and sum of hydrophobic surface areas were found to be negatively correlated. Anilides 2a-b, 4-7 and quinolones 3a-b, 8a-b, 9b and 10-14 were evaluated for DNA binding propensities and topoisomerases I/II inhibition as part of their mechanism of action. Among the anilides, only compound 7 presented some DNA binding propensity whereas the quinolones 8b, 9b and 10-14 intercalate in the DNA base pairs, compounds 8b, 9b and 14 being the most efficient ones. The strongest DNA intercalators, compounds 8b, 9b and 14, were clearly distinguished from the other compounds according to their molecular descriptors by the PCA and PLS analysis.\n",

Abstract: Carbohydrate moieties were strategically transported from the indolocarbazole topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitor class to the indenoisoquinoline system in search of structurally novel and potent Top1 inhibitors. The syntheses and biological evaluation of 20 new indenoisoquinolines glycosylated with linear and cyclic sugar moieties are reported. Aromatic ring substitution with 2,3-dimethoxy-8,9-methylenedioxy or 3-nitro groups exerted strong effects on antiproliferative and Top1 inhibitory activities. While the length of the carbohydrate side chain clearly correlated with antiproliferative activity, the relationship between stereochemistry and biological activity was less clearly defined. Twelve of the new indenoisoquinolines exhibit Top1 inhibitory activity equal to or better than that of camptothecin. An advanced synthetic intermediate from this study was also used to efficiently prepare indotecan (LMP400) and indimitecan (LMP776), two anticancer agents currently under investigation in a Phase I clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health.\n",

            "Immunotoxins (antibody-toxin fusion proteins) target surface antigens on cancer cells and kill these cells via toxin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis leading to apoptosis.  To identify genes controlling this process, a whole RNAi genome screen (approximately 22,000 genes at 3 siRNAs per gene) was conducted via monitoring the cytotoxicity of the mesothelin-directed immunotoxin, SS1P.  SS1P, a Pseudomonas exotoxin-based immunotoxin, was chosen because it is now in clinical trials and has produced some significant tumor regressions in patients.  High and low concentrations of SS1P were chosen to allow for the identification of both mitigators and sensitizers, respectively.  As expected, silencing known essential genes in the immunotoxin pathway such as mesothelin, furin, KDEL receptor 2 or the members of the diphthamide pathway protected cells.  Of potential greater interest was the observation that many RNAi targets increased immunotoxin sensitivity, indicating that these gene products normally contribute to inefficiencies in the killing pathway.  Of top sensitizers, many genes encode proteins that locate to either the ER or Golgi and in particular are annotated as part of the secretory system.  Our results highlight new potential targets for chemical intervention that could increase immunotoxin killing of cancer cells and enhance our understanding of toxin trafficking.\n",

Abstract: Drug-resistant bacterial infections and lack of available antibacterial agents in clinical practice are becoming serious risks to public health. We synthesized a new class of haloemodins by modifying a traditional Chinese medicine component, emodin. The novel haloemodin exerts strong inhibitory activity on bacterial topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase, and not on the topoisomerases of human origin. In principle, it shows remarkable antibacterial activities against laboratory and clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We further expanded its antibacterial spectrum into against Gram-negative bacteria with the assistance of polymyxin B nonapeptide, which helps haloemodin to penetrate through the bacterial outer membrane. Finally, the therapeutic effect of haloemodin in vivo was confirmed in curing S. aureus-induced keratitis on rabbit model. With distinctive structural difference from the antibiotics we used, the haloemodins are of value as promising antibacterial pharmacophore, especially for combat the infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens.\n",

Abstract: A series of 9-(alkylthiomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins and pyrano-fused camptothecin derivatives were synthesized via the reaction of topotecan hydrochloride with various thiols and alkyl vinyl ethers respectively. In the reactions, topotecan hydrochloride was utilized as ortho-quinonemethide (o-QM) precursor. The configuration of 19 was determined by (1)H NMR and NOESY spectra as syn-isomers, suggesting that the cycloaddition of topotecan with alkyl vinyl ethers could undergo a hetero Diels-Alder reaction. All the synthesized compounds were screened on cancer cell lines HepG2, KB, HCT-8 and SGC7901. Some compounds were selected to assess their inhibitory activity against Topo I via Topo I mediated DNA cleavage assays. The results showed that among those tested 9-(alkylthiomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins, the compounds with bulkier hydrophobic side chains at 9-position have better bioactivities. As well as all pyrano-fused camptothecins possess antiproliferative activity against the tested cancer cell lines.

Abstract: Novel generations of antitumor anthraquinones are expected to be advantageous over the conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Previous structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated an importance of the positively charged side chains conjugated to anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione scaffolds. Exploring a role of individual side chain moieties in binding to the duplex and G-quadruplex DNA, modulation of telomerase and topoisomerase I activities, intracellular accumulation and cytostatic potency, we herein analyzed a series of reported and newly synthesized guanidine-containing derivatives of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione. We found that the number of cationic side chains (namely, two) is critical for a tight interaction with human telomeric G-quadruplex (TelQ). Along with a larger drug-TelQ association constant, the telomerase attenuation by anthrathiophenediones with two basic groups in the side chains was more pronounced than by the analogs bearing one basic group. For mono-guanidinated compounds the substituent with the amino group in the side chain provided better TelQ affinity than the methylamine residue. The intracellular uptake of the mono-guanidino derivative with two side chains was >2-fold higher than the respective value for the bis(guanidino) derivative. This difference can explain a lower antiproliferative potency of bis(guanidine) containing compounds. Thus, the modifications of side chains of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione differently modulated drug-target interactions and cellular effects. Nevertheless, the selected compound 11-(3-aminopropylamino)-4-(2-guanidinoethylamino)anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione 13 demonstrated a high affinity to TelQ and the ability to stabilize the quadruplex structure. These properties were paralleled by reasonable potency of 13 as a telomerase/topoisomerase I inhibitor and an antiproliferative agent. These results indicate that the structural elements of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione derivatives can be balanced to yield a candidate for further preclinical study.\n",

Abstract: The first synthesis of C5-curcumin-fatty acid (C5-Curc-FA) conjugates was successfully performed. Through a two-step synthetic route, 10 analogs were synthesized for a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. It was found that C5-Curc-FA conjugates containing either decanoic acid or palmitic acid moieties were cytotoxic against colorectal adenocarcinoma cell (CCL-229) at IC50s ranging from 22.5 to 56.1μg/mL, being 5c the most active C5-Curc-FA conjugate. Our results strongly suggests that a decanoic acid moiety at the meta position in C5-Curc-FA conjugates is important for their anticancer activity effect. Possible mechanisms for the anticancer activity of C5-Curc-FA conjugates were also investigated including apoptosis induction, mitochondrial damage and caspases activation. It was shown that 5c inhibited the luminescence activity of NFκB, a key signaling molecule involved in cell apoptosis and cell proliferation, at IC50=18.2μg/mL. In addition, it was demonstrated that 5c displayed significant apoptotic effect at GI50=46.0μg/mL in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC CCL-222), which can be explained by the significant mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspases 3 and 7 activation effect of 5c. Finally, it was investigated that C5-Curc-FA conjugates can affect the replication process of cancer cells, since compounds 5c, 5e, and 6c inhibited the relaxing activity of the human DNA topoisomerase I at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that range from 50 to 250μg/mL. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that the inhibition of both NFκB and DNA topoisomerase I by C5-Curc-FA conjugates is associated with their anticancer activity.\n",

            "The mammalian innate immune system senses many bacterial stimuli through the toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Activation of the TLR4 receptor by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the most widely studied TLR pathway due to its central role in host responses to gram-negative bacterial infection and its contribution to endotoxemia and sepsis. Here we describe a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify genes regulating the human macrophage TNF-alpha response to LPS. We also conducted a secondary validation screen with six independent siRNAs per gene to facilitate removal of off-target screen hits, and we generated microarray data from the same LPS-treated macrophage cells to facilitate downstream data analysis. These data provide a resource for analyzing gene function in the predominant pathway driving inflammatory cytokine expression in human macrophages.\n",

On the basis of 3-amino-10-hydroxylevodiamine and SAHA, a series of hybrid molecules was successfully designed and synthesized. In particular, compound 8c was proven to be a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I/II and HDAC with good antiproliferative and apoptotic activities.

            "Title: Switch in Site of Inhibition: A Strategy for Structure-Based Discovery of Human Topoisomerase IIα Catalytic Inhibitors.  Abstract: A study of structure-based modulation of known ligands of hTopoIIα, an important enzyme involved in DNA processes, coupled with synthesis and in vitro assays led to the establishment of a strategy of rational switch in mode of inhibition of the enzyme's catalytic cycle. 6-Arylated derivatives of known imidazopyridine ligands were found to be selective inhibitors of hTopoIIα, while not showing TopoI inhibition and DNA binding. Interestingly, while the parent imidazopyridines acted as ATP-competitive inhibitors, arylated derivatives inhibited DNA cleavage similar to merbarone, indicating a switch in mode of inhibition from ATP-hydrolysis to the DNA-cleavage stage of catalytic cycle of the enzyme. The 6-aryl-imidazopyridines were relatively more cytotoxic than etoposide in cancer cells and less toxic to normal cells. Such unprecedented strategy will encourage research on \"choice-based change\" in target-specific mode of action for rapid drug discovery.\n",

Abstract: A critical question in natural product-based drug discovery is how to translate the product into drug-like molecules with optimal pharmacological properties. The generation of natural product-inspired scaffold diversity is an effective but challenging strategy to investigate the broader chemical space and identify promising drug leads. Extending our efforts to the natural product evodiamine, a diverse library containing 11 evodiamine-inspired novel scaffolds and their derivatives were designed and synthesized. Most of them showed good to excellent antitumor activity against various human cancer cell lines. In particular, 3-chloro-10-hydroxyl thio-evodiamine (66c) showed excellent in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy with good tolerability and low toxicity.

Abstract: Microwave-accelerated synthesis and anticancer activity of novel imine/amide-imidazole conjugates derived from 5-amino-4-cyano-N1-substituted benzyl imidazole against a panel of seven cancer cell lines are reported for the first time. Compounds ARK-4, 10 and 12 in the series show promising in vitro anti proliferative activity with low micromolar IC50 values against A-459 (lung), Hep-G2 (liver) and H-460 (liver) cancer cell lines. Compounds caused the increase in ROS levels as well as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which might induce apoptosis. Further, mechanistic interventions on biological and molecular modeling data supported that compounds inhibited topoisomerase-II selectively.\n",

Abstract: In our previous work, indolizinoquinolinedione derivative 1 was identified as a Top1 catalytic inhibitor. Herein, a series of 6-substituted indolizinoquinolinedione derivatives were synthesized through modification of the parent compound 1. Top1 cleavage and relaxation assays indicate that none of these novel compounds act as classical Top1 poison, and that the compounds with alkylamino terminus at C-6 side chain, including 8, 11-16, 18-21, 25, 26 and 28-30, are the most potent Top1 catalytic inhibitors.

The interconversion of different biaryl linkages between 1 and 4 and between 2 and 3 in DMSO by a retro-oxa-Michael mechanism provided insight into the formation of the xanthone-chromanone dimers and supported the assignments of their absolute configurations. Compounds 1-6 exhibited cytotoxicities against the seven tested cancer cell lines, with the best IC50 value of 0.7 μM. Compound 5 showed further inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I.\n",

Abstract: New batracylin conjugates with tuftsin/retro-tuftsin derivatives were designed and synthesized using T3P as a coupling agent. The conjugates possess an amide bond formed between the carboxyl group of heterocyclic molecule and the N-termini of the tuftsin/retro-tuftsin chain. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the new analogues and their precursors was evaluated using a series of human and murine tumor cells. BAT conjugates containing retro-tuftsin with branched side aminoacid chain, in particular with leucine or isoleucine, were about 10-fold more cytotoxic toward two human tumor cell lines (lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and myeloblastic leukemia (HL-60)). These compounds showed about 10-fold increased cytotoxicity against the two types of tumor cells compared to parent BAT. We have not observed important differences in the mechanism of action between BAT and its cytotoxic tuftsin/retro-tuftsin conjugates. We propose that high biological activity of the most active BAT conjugates is a result of their greatly increased intracellular accumulation.\n",

From 3-(dipropylamino)-5-methoxybenzofuro[2,3-f] quinazolin-1(2H)-one (13), we prepared 3-(dipropylamino)-5-hydroxybenzofuro[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-one (18), referred to as DPA-HBFQ-1.

In particular, the latter was able to inhibit anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth and to induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive and -negative breast cancer cells. It did not affect proliferation and apoptotic responses in MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells. The observed effects have been ascribed to an enhanced p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression in a p53-dependent manner of tumor suppressor and to a selective inhibition of human topoisomerase II.

Mechanism studies indicated that compound 10a induced cell cycle arrest at S phase via activation of caspase-3, -7 and an increase in the protein expression of Bad and Bax but a decrease in expression of Bcl-2 and PARP, which consequently cause cell death. In addition, compound 10a attenuated the levels of phosphorylated Src, Akt-1, and Akt-2 protein levels but did not affect the total protein expression of Akt.

            "Title: 10-Boronic acid substituted camptothecin as prodrug of SN-38.  Abstract: Malignant tumor cells have been found to have high levels of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), supporting the hypothesis that a prodrug could be activated by intracellular H2O2 and lead to a potential antitumor therapy. In this study, the 7-ethyl-10-boronic acid camptothecin (B1) was synthesized for the first time as prodrug of SN-38, by linking a cleavable aryl carbon-boron bond to the SN-38. Prodrug B1 selectively activated by H2O2, converted rapidly to the active form SN-38 under favorable oxidative conditions in cancer cells with elevated levels of H2O2. The cell survival assay showed that prodrug B1 was equally or more effective in inhibiting the growth of six different cancer cells, as compared to SN-38. Unexpectedly, prodrug B1 displayed even more potent Topo I inhibitory activity than SN-38, suggesting that it was not only a prodrug of SN-38 but also a typical Topo I inhibitor. Prodrug B1 also demonstrated a significant antitumor activity at 2.0 mg/kg in a xenograft model using human brain star glioblastoma cell lines U87MG.\n",

In this study, a series of novel securinine derivatives bearing β'-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety were designed and synthesized via a Baylis-Hillman reaction for screening as Topo I inhibitors and antitumor agents. Their topoisomerase I inhibitory activity as well as their cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines (A549, HeLa, HepG2, SH-SY5Y) were evaluated, and two pairs of diastereomers 4a-1 and 4a-6 with significant Topo I inhibitory activity and potent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cell lines were identified. The diastereomers were separated, and absolute configurations of five pairs of diastereomers were identified based on X-ray crystallographic analysis and circular dichroism (CD) spectra analysis. Further mechanism studies of the most active compounds 4a-1-R and 4a-1-S indicated that this kind of securinine derivative exhibits a different inhibitory mechanism from that of camptothecin, an established Topo I inhibitor. Unlike camptothecin, compounds 4a-1-R and 4a-1-S specifically inhibits the combination of Topo I and DNA rather than forming the drug-enzyme-DNA covalent ternary complex.

            "Title: Fluorescein hydrazones: A series of novel non-intercalative topoisomerase IIα catalytic inhibitors induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in breast and colon cancer cells.  Abstract: Fluorescein hydrazones (5 and 7) were synthesized in three/four steps with 82-92% yields. All synthesized compounds were evaluated by topoisomerase I (topo I) and topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα)-mediated relaxation and cell viability assays. Among them, most of the compounds showed topo I & IIα inhibitory activity and nineteen compounds showed strong anti-proliferative activity against various cell lines. In brief, 5e inhibited 53% topo IIα (etoposide 29%) at 20 μM and showed excellent antiproliferative activity against DU145 (1.43 ± 0.04 μM), HCT15 (2.4 ± 0.03 μM) and MCF7 (11.4 ± 0.5 μM) cell lines in comparison with adriamycin, etoposide, and camptothecin. Compounds 5e, 5g and 5h were further evaluated to determine their mode of action. Compounds 5e, 5g and 5h functioned as non-intercalative topo IIα catalytic inhibitor with induction of G1 arrest and activation of apoptotic proteins in dose-dependent manner.\n",

Abstract: Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects, among other areas, both sides of the Mediterranean Basin. The drugs classically used in clinical practice are pentavalent antimonials (SbV) and amphotericin B, which are nephrotoxic, require parenteral administration, and increasing drug resistance in visceral leishmaniasis has been observed. These circumstances justify the search of new families of compounds to find effective drugs against the disease. Eukaryotic type I DNA topoisomerase (TopIB) has been found essential for the viability of the parasites, and therefore represents a promising target in the development of an antileishmanial therapy. In this search, heterocyclic compounds, such as 1,5-naphthyridines, have been prepared by cycloaddition reaction between N-(3-pyridyl)aldimines and acetylenes and their antileishmanial activity on promastigotes and amastigote-infected splenocytes of Leishmania infantum has been evaluated. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of newly synthesized compounds were assessed on host murine splenocytes in order to calculate the corresponding selective indexes (SI). Excellent antileishmanial activity of 1,5-naphthyridine 19, 21, 22, 24 and 27 has been observed with similar activity than the standard drug amphotericin B and higher selective index (SI > 100) towards L. infantum amastigotes than amphotericin B (SI > 62.5). Special interest shows the 1,5-naphthyridine 22 with an IC50 value (0.58 ± 0.03 μM) similar to the standard drug amphotericin B (0.32 ± 0.05 μM) and with the highest selective index (SI = 271.5). In addition, this compound shows remarkable inhibition on leishmanial TopIB. However, despite these interesting results, further studies are needed to disclose other potential targets involved in the antileishmanial effect of these novel compounds.\n",

Abstract: Based on the mechanism of action, novel scaffolds as Topo I inhibitors bearing indole and sophoridinine were designed. Preliminary docking study revealed that some molecules among the designed series possessed promising Topo I inhibitor properties. Subsequently, thirty new compounds were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and Mass spectral analyses. The compounds were then screened for their antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibitory activities. The results affirmed the consistency between docking and activities and the rationality of the design strategy. Furthermore, compound 10b was chosen as a representative compound to test its anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that 10b caused prominent S phase cell cycle arrest and significantly suppressed tumor growth in HepG2 cell derived mouse model. These findings present a promising series of lead molecules which can serve as potential Topo I inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and a theoretical basis for structural modifications.\n",

            "Title: New antitumor anthra[2,3-b]furan-3-carboxamides: Synthesis and structure-activity relationship.  Abstract: Chemical modifications of the anthraquinone scaffold are aimed at optimization of this exceptionally productive class of antitumor drugs. In particular, our previously reported anthra[2,3-b]furan-3-carboxamides demonstrated a high cytotoxic potency in cell culture and in vivo. In this study, we expanded our series of anthra[2,3-b]furan-3-carboxamides by modifying the key functional groups and dissected the structure-activity relationship within this chemotype. The majority of new compounds inhibited the growth of mammalian tumor cell lines at submicromolar to low micromolar concentrations. We found that 4,11-hydroxy groups as well as the carbonyl moiety in the carboxamide fragment were critical for cytotoxicity whereas the substituent at the 2-position of anthra[2,3-b]furan was not. Importantly, the new derivatives were similarly potent against wild type cells and their variants resistant to doxorubicin due to P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression or p53 inactivation. The most cytotoxic derivatives 6 and 9 attenuated plasmid DNA relaxation by topoisomerase 1. Finally, we demonstrated that 6 and 9 at 1 μM induced intracellular oxidative stress, accumulation in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and apoptosis in gastric carcinoma cell lines regardless of their p53 status. These results further substantiate the potential of anthra[2,3-b]furan-3-carboxamides as antitumor drug candidates.\n",

            "Title: Structure-based discovery of cytotoxic dimeric tetrahydroxanthones as potential topoisomerase I inhibitors from a marine-derived fungus.  Abstract: DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I) is an important anticancer drug target, and xanthone dimers are considered to be a new kind of Topo I inhibitor chemotypes. Based on the characteristics of dimeric xanthone structures, five new dimeric xanthones (1-5) and two known SAD isomers (6 and 7) were isolated from the mangrove-derived fungus Aspergillus vericolor. The absolute configurations of compounds 1-7, entailing both central and axial chirality elements, were established by a combination of ECD comparison, chemical conversions, and biogenetic considerations. Compounds 1-7 possessed high structural diversity and exhibited cytotoxicity at different levels. The selected new compounds 1, 2, and 5 showed Topo I inhibition properties and the most potent compound 1, an atropisomer of compound 2, was confirmed to inhibit Topo I-mediated DNA relaxation by targeting Topo I, thereby, arresting the cell cycle process and inducing necrosis in cancer cells.

Abstract: As part of our effort to develop potential topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) targeting anticancer agents, we systematically designed a new series of hydroxy and chloro-substituted 2,4-diphenyl 5H-chromeno[4,3-b]pyridines. Total eighteen compounds were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the function of topo I and IIα, and proliferation of human breast (T47D), colorectal (HCT15), and cervix (HeLa) cancer cells. Except compound 11, all of the tested compounds displayed selective topo IIα inhibitory activity. Compounds 8-18, 22, 24, and 25 showed excellent topo IIα inhibitory activity than a positive control, etoposide. Most of the compounds appeared to be superior to reference compounds in their antiproliferative activity. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has shown that it is better to place the hydroxyphenyl group at the 4-position of the central pyridine for superior topo IIα inhibition and antiproliferative activity. Similarly, the 3'-, or 4'-hydroxyphenyl substitution at the 2- and 4-positon of pyridine ring is important for better activity than 2'-substitution.\n",

Abstract: Multitarget inhibitors design has generated great interest in cancer treatment. Based on the synergistic effects of topoisomerase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, we designed and synthesized a new series of acridine hydroxamic acid derivatives as potential novel dual Topo and HDAC inhibitors. MTT assays indicated that all the hybrid compounds displayed good antiproliferative activities with IC50 values in low micromolar range, among which compound 8c displayed potent activity against U937 (IC50 = 0.90 μM). In addition, compound 8c also displayed the best HDAC inhibitory activity, which was several times more potent than HDAC inhibitor SAHA. Subsequent studies indicated that all the compounds displayed Topo II inhibition activity at 50 μM. Moreover, compound 8c could interact with DNA and induce U937 apoptosis. This study provides a suite of compounds for further exploration of dual Topo and HDAC inhibitors, and compound 8c can be a new dual Topo and HDAC inhibitory anticancer agent.\n",

Abstract: Taking sophoridine as a lead compound, 58 sophoridine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity in the HepG2 cancer cell line. Among the 58 compounds, 33 compounds showed potent antiproliferative activity with IC50 less than 10 μM. Compound 5w showed the most potent anti-proliferative activity in the HepG2 cancer cell line. Thus, we further extended our characterization of the antiproliferative activity of 5w in six cancer cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721, Hela, CNE1, CNE2 and MCF7). The representative compound 5w displayed robust anti-proliferative activities in all the tested cell lines with IC50 values in range of 0.93-1.89 μM which were much lower than that of sophoridine. Here, we report the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in a sophoridine series of compounds, which indicated that introduction of N-benzyl indole group on the 14-carbon atom of sophoridine can significantly enhance the antiproliferative activity. By molecular docking and enzymatic assay, compound 5w was found to be able to inhibit the activity of DNA Topo I. Furthermore, apoptosis assay displayed that compound 5w could significantly induce the apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner by activating caspase-3, increasing expression of cleaved caspase-3 and reducing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The in vivo antitumor assay demonstrated that 5w suppressed the growth of HepG2 xenografts in nude mice without any obvious side effects.\n",

The results from Topo II-mediated pBR322 DNA relaxation and cleavage assays showed that the synthesized compounds might act as Topo II catalytic inhibitors. Certain compounds displayed potent Topo II inhibition at 10 μM. The cytotoxic activities of these compounds against HeLa, A549, Raji, PC-3, MDA-MB-201, and HL-60 cancer cell lines were evaluated. The results indicated that these compounds exhibited strong antiproliferative activity. A good relationship was observed between the Topo II inhibitory potency and the cytotoxicity of these compounds. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the electronic effects, the phenyl group, and the rhodanine moiety were particularly important for the Topo II inhibitory potency and cytotoxicity.\n",

Abstract: The present account describes the discovery and development of a new benzo[ c]pyrrolo[2,3- h][1,6]naphthyridin-5-one (BPN) JAK inhibitory chemotype that has produced selective JAK inhibitors. Sequential palladium chemistry was optimized for the rapid access to a focused library of derivatives to explore the structure-activity relationships of the new scaffold. Several compounds from the series displayed potencies in the low nanomolar range against the four members of the JAK family with various selectivity profiles. Compound 20a, with an azetidine amide side chain, showed the best selectivity for JAK1 kinase vs JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, with low nanomolar potency (IC50 = 3.4 nM). On the other hand, BPNs 17b and 18 had good general activity against the JAK family with excellent kinome selectivity profiles. Many of the new BPNs inhibited JAK3-mediated STAT-5 phosphorylation, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and the proliferation of primary T cells. Moreover, BPN 17b showed very similar in vivo results to tofacitinib in a rheumatoid arthritis animal model.\n",

Abstract: Novel series of conformationally constrained 2,4-chloro- and hydroxy-substituted diphenyl benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridines were rationally designed and synthesized. Their biological activities were evaluated for topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, and antiproliferative activity against several human cancer cell lines for the development of novel anticancer agents.

Abstract: A novel series of bis(hydroxymethyl)indolizino[8,7-b]indole hybrids composed of β-carboline (topoisomerase I/II inhibition) and bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrole (DNA cross-linking) are synthesized for antitumor evaluation. Of tumor cell lines tested, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines are the most sensitive to the newly synthesized compounds. These hybrids induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, trigger tumor cell apoptotic death, and display diverse mechanisms of action involving topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibition and induction of DNA cross-linking. Intriguingly, the substituent at N11 (H or Me) plays a critical role in modulating Topo II inhibition and DNA cross-linking activities. N11-Me derivatives predispose to induce DNA crosslinks, whereas N11-H derivatives potently inhibit Topo II. Computational analysis implicates that N11-Me restrict the torsion angles of the two adjacent OH on pyrrole resulting in a favorable of DNA cross-linking. Among these hybrids, compound 17a with N11-H is more effective than cisplatin and etoposide, but as potent as irinotecan, against the growth of SCLC H526 cells in xenograft model.\n",

Abstract: Sorafenib was the only small-molecule drug approved by FDA for treatment of the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent study indicated that YM155 was a promising agent for HCC cells with high survivin expression, however, the antitumor activity needs to be further improved. Based on molecular docking and rational design method, a series of multi-substituted benzyl acridone derivatives were designed and synthesized. MTT assay indicated that some of the synthesized compounds displayed better antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells than YM155. Later study indicated that the representive compound 8u may directly interact with survivin protein and induce HepG2 cells apoptosis, which is different from YM155. In addition, ADME property was predicted in silico, and it performed well. Moreover, in vivo preliminary experiments showed that 8u may be a good lead compound in the treatment of HCC.\n",

Bisbenzimidazoles with alkynyl side chains display excellent E. coli DNA topoisomerase I inhibition properties with IC50 values <5.0 μM. Several bisbenzimidazoles (3, 6, 7, 8) also inhibit RNA topoisomerase activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. Bisbenzimidazoles inhibit bacterial growth much better than monobenzimidazoles for Gram-positive strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was much lower for Gram positive bacteria (Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., including two MRSA strains 0.3-8 μg/mL) than for the majority of Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16-32 μg/mL, Klebsiella pneumoniae > 32 μg/mL). Bisbenzimidazoles showed varied stabilization of B-DNA duplex (1.2-23.4 °C), and cytotoxicity studies show similar variation dependent upon the side chain length. Modeling studies suggest critical interactions between the inhibitor side chain and amino acids of the active site of DNA topoisomerase I.\n",

Abstract: A new series of thirteen N-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-phenylalanine and N-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-aspartic acid-β-benzyl ester compounds were synthesized and evaluated for antiproliferative activity against four different human cancer cell lines: cervical cancer (HeLa), lung cancer (A549), gastric cancer (MGC-803) and breast cancer (MCF-7) as well as topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activity. Compounds (5a, 5b, 5e, 8a, 8b) showed significant antiproliferative activity with low IC50 values against the four cancer cell lines. Equally, compounds 5a, 5b, 5e, 5f, 8a, 8d, 8e and 8f showed topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity at 100μM with 5b, 5e, 8f exhibiting potential topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity compared to positive control at 100μM and 20μM, respectively. Conversely compounds 5e, 5f, 5g and 8a showed weaker topoisomerase I inhibitory activity compared to positive control at 100μM. Compound 5b exhibited the most potent topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity at low concentration and better antiproliferative activity against the four human cancer cell lines. The molecular interactions between compounds 5a-5g, 8a-8f and the topoisomerase IIα (PDB ID: 1ZXM) were further investigated through molecular docking. The results indicated that these compounds could serve as promising leads for further optimization as novel antitumor agents.\n",

Abstract: DNA and DNA-related enzymes are one of the most effective and common used intracellular anticancer targets in clinic and laboratory studies, however, most of DNA-targeting drugs suffered from toxic side effects. Development of new molecules with good antitumor activity and low side effects is important. Based on computer aided design and our previous studies, a series of novel azaacridine derivatives were synthesized as DNA and topoisomerases binding agents, among which compound 9 displayed the best antiproliferative activity with an IC50 value of 0.57μM against U937 cells, which was slightly better than m-AMSA. In addition, compound 9 displayed low cytotoxicity against human normal liver cells (QSG-7701), the IC50 of which was more than 3 times lower than m-AMSA. Later study indicated that all the compounds displayed topoisomerases II inhibition activity at 50μM. The representative compound 9 could bind with DNA and induce U937 apoptosis through the exogenous pathway.\n",

Abstract: The 7-azaindenoisoquinolines are cytotoxic topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors. Previously reported representatives bear a 3-nitro group. The present report documents the replacement of the potentially genotoxic 3-nitro group by 3-chloro and 3-fluoro substituents, resulting in compounds with high Top1 inhibitory activities and potent cytotoxicities in human cancer cell cultures and reduced lethality in an animal model. Some of the new Top1 inhibitors also possess moderate inhibitory activities against tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2), two enzymes that are involved in DNA damage repair resulting from Top1 inhibitors, and they produce significantly more DNA damage in cancer cells than in normal cells. Eighteen of the new compounds had cytotoxicity mean-graph midpoint (MGM) GI50 values in the submicromolar (0.033-0.630 μM) range. Compounds 16b and 17b are the most potent in human cancer cell cultures with MGM GI50 values of 0.063 and 0.033 μM, respectively.

Further mechanistic evaluations indicated that 11l treatment in MCF-7 cells induced accumulated DNA double-strand breaks, prompted remarkable apoptosis, and caused prominent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, 11l greatly suppressed tumor growth in mice, and displayed favorable metabolic properties in liver microsomes. Our study suggested that single agents inhibiting Topo and PARP concurrently might be an alternative for cancer therapy and 11l represented a potential lead compound for development of antitumor agents.\n",

            "Title: Synthesis of novel indole derivatives as promising DNA-binding agents and evaluation of antitumor and antitopoisomerase I activities.  Abstract: Molecules bearing indole nucleus present diverse biological properties such as antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities that can be associated both to DNA and protein interactions. This study focused on the synthesis of new indole derivatives with thiazolidines and imidazolidine rings condensed as side chains as well as the evaluation of their ability to interact with the DNA and antitumor and topoisomerase inhibition activities. All derivatives were successfully synthesized and their structures were elucidated by mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR), spectroscopy 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY 1H-1H and HSQC 1H-13C. The antitumor activity was evaluated against different cancer cell lines using the antiproliferative MTT assay. DNA binding ability was analyzed by absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence technique using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescent probe. Changes were observed in spectroscopic properties of the compounds after interacting with ctDNA (calf thymus DNA), with hypochromic and hyperchromic effects, besides blue or red shifts in the maxima of spectra. The indole derivative 5-(1H-Indol-3-ylmethylene)-thiazolidin-2,4-dione (4c) presented the best results in antitumor assay against the breast line tested (T47D), with IC50 value lower than the positive control, doxorubicin (1.93 and 4.61 μM, respectively). On the other hand, the compound 3-amino-5-(1H-indol-3-ylmethylene)-2-thioxo-thiazolidin-4-one (4a) was active against leukemia cell lines (HL60 and K562) with the high value of the DNA binding constant, Kb of 5.69 × 104. However, this compound (4a) did not inhibit the topoisomerase-I activity evaluated by relaxation assay. These results show that the indole nucleus contribute to the incorporation of molecules into the DNA. Moreover, it was highlighted that basic side chains, such as thiazolidines and imidazolidines, and free amino group, are relevant for design of promising antitumor and DNA binding compounds.\n",

Abstract: Inspired by the common structural characteristics of numerous known antitumor compounds targeting DNA or topoisomerase I, 3-(benzazol-2-yl)-quinoxaline-based scaffold was designed via the combination of two important privileged structure units -quinoxaline and benzazole. Thirty novel 3-(benzazol-2-yl)-quinoxaline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities. The MTT assay indicated that most compounds possessed moderate to potent antiproliferation effects against MGC-803, HepG2, A549, HeLa, T-24 and WI-38 cell lines. 3-(Benzoxazol- -2-yl)-2-(N-3-dimethylaminopropyl)aminoquinoxaline (12a) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.49 to 10.99 μM against the five tested cancer and one normal cell line. Agarose-gel electrophoresis assays suggested that 12a did not interact with intact DNA, but rather it strongly inhibited topoisomerase I (Topo I) via Topo I-mediated DNA unwinding to exert its anticancer activity. The molecular modeling study indicated that 12a adopt a unique mode to interact with DNA and Topo I. Detailed biological study of 12a in MGC-803 cells revealed that 12a could arrest the cell cycle in G2 phase, inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the fluctuation of intracellular Ca2+, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Western Blot analysis indicated that 12a-treatment could significantly up-regulate the levels of pro-apoptosis proteins Bak, Bax, and Bim, down-regulate anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and increase levels of cyclin B1 and CDKs inhibitor p21, cytochrome c, caspase-3, caspase-9 and their activated form in MGC-803 cells in a dose-dependent manner to induce cell apoptosis via a caspase-dependent intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway. Studies in MGC-803 xenograft tumors models demonstrated that 12a could signiﬁcantly reduce tumor growth in vivo at doses as low as 6 mg/kg with low toxicity. Its convenient preparation and potent anticancer efficacy in vivo makes the 3-(benzazol-2-yl)quinoxaline scaffold a promising new chemistry entity for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.\n",

Abstract: A series of new pyrazole linked benzothiazole-β-naphthol derivatives were designed and synthesized using a simple, efficient and ecofriendly route under catalyst-free conditions in good to excellent yields. These derivatives were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on selected human cancer cell lines. Among those, the derivatives 4j, 4k and 4l exhibited considerable cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging between 4.63 and 5.54 µM against human cervical cancer cells (HeLa). Structure activity relationship was elucidated by varying different substituents on benzothiazoles and pyrazoles. Further, flow cytometric analysis revealed that these derivatives induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and spectroscopic studies such as UV-visible, fluorescence and circular dichroism studies showed that these derivatives exhibited good DNA binding affinity. Additionally, these derivatives can effectively inhibit the topoisomerase I activity.

            "Title: Probing structural requirements for human topoisomerase I inhibition by a novel N1-Biphenyl fluoroquinolone.  Abstract: Fluoroquinolones substituted with N-1 biphenyl and napthyl groups were discovered to act as catalytically inhibitors of human topoisomerases I and II, and to possess anti-proliferative activity in vivo. Structural requirements for these novel quinolones to inhibit catalytic activity of human topoisomerase I have not been explored. In this work novel derivatives of the N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolone were designed, synthesized and evaluated to understand structural requirements of the C-3 carboxylic acid, C-6 fluorine, C-7 aminomethylpyrrolidine, C-8 methoxy, and the N-1 biphenyl functional groups for hTopoI inhibition. Characterization of each analog for inhibition of hTopoI catalytic inhibition reveals critical insight into structural requirements of these novel quinolones for activity. Additionally, results of DNA binding and modeling studies suggest that N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolones intercalate between the DNA base pairs with the N-1 biphenyl functional group, rather than the quinolone core, and that this mode of DNA intercalation contributes to inhibition of hTopoI by these novel structures. The results presented here support further development and evaluation of N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolone analogs as a novel class of anti-cancer agents that act through catalytic inhibition of hTopoI.\n",

Abstract: Ganoderma lucidum is a multi-purpose plant medicine that is homologous to functional food. The most attractive properties of G. lucidum are its immunomodulatory and antitumour activities, which are mainly attributed to the following two major active components: G. lucidum polysaccharides and G. lucidum triterpenoids (GLTs). GLTs are effective as supplemental therapies and improve health when combined with other medications to treat hepatitis, fatigue syndrome, and prostate cancer. However, research investigating the mechanism and application of G. lucidum or GLTs in the treatment of diseases remains preliminary in terms of both the utilization efficacy and product type. This review offers comprehensive insight into the pharmacological activities of GLTs and their potential applications in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Specifically, 83 GLTs were selected, and their molecular structures and chemical formulas were described. We also describe 7 ganoderic acids that are currently at different stages of clinical trials (ganoderic acids A, C2, D, F, DM, X and Y). The related pharmacodynamic mechanisms and targeted signalling proteins were further analysed. Notably, the specific relationship between autophagy and apoptosis induced by ganoderic acid DM is summarized here for the first time.\n",

Mechanistic analyses confirmed that these novel conjugates could bind to eHSP90 and be selectively internalized into the tumor cells, which led to prolonged tumor regression in multiple models of cancer. Among all studied conjugates, compound 18b showed excellent in vitro activities, including acceptable HSP90α affinity and potent antitumor activity. Moreover, compound 18b exhibited superior antitumor activity and low toxicity in HCT116 and Capan-1 xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic analyses in HCT116 and Capan-1 xenografts further confirmed that compound 18b treatment could lead to effective cleavage and extended SN38 exposure at tumor sites.

Abstract: This work describes the synthesis of hybrid tetrahydro-1,5-naphthyridine and 1,5-naphthyridine derivatives fused with heterocycles such as chromenes and chromen-2-ones or coumarins, which were synthesized in good to high general yields. The synthetic route involves an intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction of functionalized aldimines obtained by the condensation of 3-aminopyridine and aldehydes containing a double or triple carbon-carbon bond in orto position and allows the selective generation of three stereogenic centers in a short, efficient and reliable synthesis. The subsequent dehydrogenation of the fused tetrahydrochromeno[4,3-b][1,5]naphthyridines and/or tetrahydrochromeno[4,3-b][1,5]naphthyridin-6-ones leads to the formation of the corresponding tetracyclic chromeno[4,3-b][1,5]naphthyridine derivatives and/or chromeno[4,3-b][1,5]naphthyridin-6-ones in quantitative yields.

Abstract: 3-(Alkyl(dialkyl)amino)benzothieno[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-ones (4-9) have been designed using Ellipticine structure as a model, replacing the carbazole core and the pyridine ring with a dibenzothiophene and a pyrimidine moiety, respectively. New benzothienoquinazolinones (4-9) have been synthesized by a simple one-pot reaction employing 3-aminodibenzothiophene as starting material. The benzothienoquinazolinones obtained (4-9), were evaluated for their anticancer activity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The results revealed that compounds 4 and 7 presented a good antitumor activity toward the triple negative MDA-MB-231, without cytotoxicity against non-tumoral cells. Furthermore, the compounds 4 and 7 can be considered important molecular multi-target tools for their dual inhibition of different cellular proteins, i.e. Tubulin and human Topoisomerase I, involved in relevant cellular processes, as predicted by in silico studies and demonstrated by in vitro assays (for compound 4).\n",

Good antileishmanial activity of functionalized tetrahydroquinolines 4a, 5a, 6b and quinoline 8b has been observed with similar activity than the standard drug amphotericin B and close selective index (SI between 43 and 57) towards L. infantum amastigotes to amphotericin B. Special interest shows tetrahydroquinolylphosphine sulfide 5a with an EC<sub>50</sub> value (0.61 ± 0.18 μM) similar to the standard drug amphotericin B (0.32 ± 0.05 μM) and selective index (SI = 56.87). In addition, compound 4c shows remarkable inhibition on Leishmania topoisomerase IB. Parallel theoretical study of stereoelectronic properties, application of docking-based virtual screening methods, along with molecular electrostatic potential and predictive druggability analyses are also reported.\n",

            "Title: Design, synthesis and biological research of novel N-phenylbenzamide-4-methylamine acridine derivatives as potential topoisomerase I/II and apoptosis-inducing agents.  Abstract: A series of novel N-phenylbenzamide-4-methylamine acridine derivatives were designed and synthesized based initially on the structure of amsacrine (m-AMSA). Molecular docking suggested that the representative compound 9a had affinity for binding DNA topoisomerase (Topo) II, which was comparable with that of m-AMSA, and furthermore that 9a could have preferential interactions with Topo I. After synthesis of 9a and analogues 9b-9f, these were all tested in vitro and the synthesized compounds displayed potent antiproliferative activity against three different cancer cell lines (K562, CCRF-CEM and U937). Among them, compounds 9b, 9c and 9d exhibiting the highest activity with IC<sub>50</sub> value ranging from 0.82 to 0.91 μM against CCRF-CEM cells. In addition, 9b and 9d also showed high antiproliferative activity against U937 cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.33 and 0.23 μM, respectively. The pharmacological mechanistic studies of these compounds were evaluated by Topo I/II inhibition, western blot assay and cell apoptosis detection.

            "Title: Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase inhibitors: Progress and potential.  Abstract: DNA topoisomerases are essential during transcription and replication. The therapeutic mechanism of action of topoisomerase inhibitors is enzyme poisoning rather than catalytic inhibition. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases 1 or 2 were found as DNA repair enzymes hydrolyzing the covalent bond between the tyrosyl residue of topoisomerases I or II and the 3'- or 5'-phosphate groups in DNA, respectively. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 is a key enzyme in DNA repair machinery and a promising target for antitumor and neurodegenerative therapy. Inhibitors of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 could act synergistically with topoisomerase I inhibitors and thereby potentiate the effects of topoisomerase I poisons. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 is an enzyme that specifically repairs DNA damages induced by topoisomerase II poisons and causes resistance to these drugs. Selective inhibition of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 may be a novel approach to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to topoisomerase II-targeted drug therapy. Thus, agents that inhibit tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases 1 and 2 have many applications in biochemical and physiological research and they have the potential to become anticancer and antiviral drugs. The structures, mechanism of action and therapeutic rationale of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase inhibitors and their development for combinations with topoisomerase inhibitors and DNA damaging agents are discussed.\n",

            "Title: New anthra[2,3-b]furancarboxamides: A role of positioning of the carboxamide moiety in antitumor properties.  Abstract: Derivatives of the anthraquinone (anthracene-9,10-dione) such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and others have proved great clinical efficacy for decades. Currently the search in this exceptionally productive chemical class is aimed at optimization of antitumor properties including circumvention of drug resistance. Previously we have reported that heteroarene-fused anthraquinones fused to a 5-membered heterocyclic ring are advantageous in killing drug resistant tumor cells. Herein we present the synthesis and antitumor properties of a series of new anthra[2,3-b]furan-2-carboxamides. Vast majority of new derivatives were similarly cytotoxic to wild type tumor cell lines and their isogenic sublines with P-glycoprotein overexpression and/or p53 inactivation. Comparison of structurally close derivatives varying in their position relative to the furan moiety, that is, furan-3-carboxamide 1vs furan-2-carboxamides 5 and 6, revealed fundamental differences in the cytotoxicity profiles, formation of drug-DNA complexes, efficacy of topoisomerase 1 inhibition and mechanisms of tumor cell death. Together with previous SAR data on the role of individual substituents, these results provide evidence that regioisomerization of anthra[2,3-b]furancarboxamides generates the practically perspective derivatives whose properties may vary significantly.\n",

Abstract: Betulinic acid (BA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, exhibits broad spectrum antiproliferative activity, but generally with only modest potency. To improve BA's pharmacological properties, fluorine was introduced as a single atom at C-2, creating two diastereomers, or in a trifluoromethyl group at C-3. We evaluated the impact of these groups on antiproliferative activity against five human tumor cell lines. A racemic 2-F-BA (compound 6) showed significantly improved antiproliferative activity, while each diastereomer exhibited similar effects.

In vitro evaluation revealed that they displayed similar or superior cytotoxicity compared to the positive drug irinotecan against A549, MCF-7, SK-OV-3, MG-63, U2OS and multidrug-resistant (MDR) SK-OV-3/CDDP cancer cell lines.

Moreover, cellular mechanism studies suggested that 9b arrested cell cycle at S stage and induced cell apoptosis along with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Interestingly, 9b significantly inhibited tumor growth in SK-OV-3 xenograft models in vivo without apparent toxicity, which was better than the positive drug irinotecan.

Abstract: In order to develop potent anticaner agents, a novel series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2,3,3a,4-tetrahydrothiochromeno[4,3-c]pyrazole derivatives were synthesized. Structures of all compounds were confirmed. MTT assay has been employed to study antiproliferative activity of these compounds with four human cancer cell lines (MGC-803, Hela, MCF-7 and Bel-7404) and a normal cell line L929. Most of these compounds showed potential anticancer activity and low cytotoxicity on normal cell in vitro. 7d and 7f showed the best anticancer activity, whose IC value is 15.43 μM and 20.54 μM towards MGC-803, respectively. Most of them exhibited topoisomerase II selective inhibitory. Cleavage reaction assay and DNA unwinding assay showed that 7f was a nonintercalative Topo II catalytic inhibitor, which was consistent with the docking results. Laser scanning confocal microscopy system tracks the location of representative compounds 7d and 7f which can be abundantly entering the nucleus. In particular, the most potent compounds 7d and 7f were shown to be able to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MGC-803 cells.\n",

Abstract: In this paper, we present a copper(I)-catalyzed nitrile-addition/N-arylation ring-closure cascade for the synthesis of 5,11-dihydro-6H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-ones from 2-(2-bromophenyl)-N-(2-cyanophenyl)acetamides. Using CuBr and t-BuONa in dimethylformamide (DMF) as the optimal reaction conditions, the cascade reaction gave the target products, in high yields, with a good substrate scope. Application of the cascade reaction was demonstrated on the concise total syntheses of alkaloid isocryptolepine. Further optimization of the products from the cascade reaction led to 3-chloro-5,12-bis[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-5,12-dihydro-6H-[1,3]dioxolo[4',5':5,6]indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-one (2k), which exhibited the characteristic DNA topoisomerase-I inhibitory mechanism of action with potent in vitro anticancer activity.

            "Title: Discovery of Evodiamine Derivatives as Highly Selective PDE5 Inhibitors Targeting a Unique Allosteric Pocket.  Abstract: Clinical use of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors is limited by several side effects due to weak isoform selectivity. Herein, a unique allosteric pocket of PDE5 is identified by molecular modeling and structural biology, which enables the discovery of highly selective PDE5 inhibitors from natural product evodiamine (EVO). The crystal structure of PDE5 with bound EVO derivative ( S )-7e revealed that binding of ( S )-7e to the novel allosteric pocket induced dramatic conformation changes in the H-loop with a maximum 24 Å movement of their Cα atoms. This movement directly blocks the binding of substrate/inhibitors to the PDE5 active site, which is different from all traditional PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. These derivatives showed >570-fold selectivity over PDE6C and PDE11A and achieved potent efficacy for the effective treatment of pulmonary hypertension in vivo.\n",

In this work, a new set of 2-(2-(substituted) hydrazinyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl) thiazoles 4a-q were designed as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and synthesized using concise synthetic methods. The new target compounds have been evaluated in vitro for their suppression activity against EGFR TK. Compounds 4n, 4h, 4i, 4a and 4d exhibited significant potency in comparison with erlotinib which served as a reference drug (IC50, 71.67-152.59 nM; IC50 erlotinib, 152.59 nM). Furthermore, MTT assay revealed that compounds 4j, 4a, 4f, 4h, 4n produced the most promising cytotoxic potency against the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) (IC50; 5.96-11.91 µM; IC50 erlotinib; 4.15 µM). Compound 4a showed promising activity as EGFR TK inhibitor as well as anti-breast cancer agent. In addition, 4a induced apoptotic effect and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase preventing the mitotic cycle in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, 4a upregulated the oncogenic parameters; caspase-3, p53, Bax/Bcl-2 as well as it inhibited the level of PARP-1 enzyme. QSAR study was carried out for the new derivatives and it revealed the goodness of the models. Furthermore, molecular docking studies represented the binding modes of the promising compounds in the active pocket of EGFR.\n",

To modify its physicochemical property and biological activity, a series of mono- and di-glycosylated derivatives were designed and synthesized through 22-26 multi-steps. Their inhibition of human Topo I was evaluated, and most of the glycosylated derivatives exhibited high potency in inhibiting Topo I activity as well as lamellarin D. All the 15 target compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines. The typical lamellarin derivative ZL-3 exhibited the best activity with IC values of 3 nM, 10 nM, and 15 nM against human lung cancer A549 cells, human colon cancer HCT116 cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Compound ZL-1 exhibited anti-cancer activity with IC of 14 nM and 24 nM against human colon cancer HCT116 cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, respectively.

The in vitro anticancer activity of these two series of compounds was evaluated at one dose level using NCI-60 cancer cell lines panel. Compounds 14e-h and 14m-p, with p-substituted phenyl at C2 and propyl linker at C4, were the most potent and were selected for assay at five doses level in which they exhibited potent anticancer activity at sub-micromolar level against diverse cancer cell lines. Compound 14m was the most potent with full panel GI MG-MID 1.26 μM and the most sensitive cancers were colon cancer, leukemia and melanoma with GI MG-MID 0.875, 0.904 and 0.926 μM, respectively. Melanoma (LOX IMVI) was the most sensitive cell line to all tested compounds displaying GI from 0.116 to 0.227 μM, TGI from 0.275 to 0.592 μM and LC at sub-micromolar concentration against almost of the tested compounds.

Six (8, 10, 12, 14, 19, and 26) of 23 compounds showed strong inhibitory activities against Topo-mediated DNA relaxation and proliferation of five human cell lines including breast (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7), colorectal (HCT116) and non-small cell lung (H1299) cancers. Among these, compounds 14 and 26 exhibited full inhibitory activities against Topo I at 3 μM and Topo IIα at 1 μM. Cancer cells treated with 26 accumulated DNA damage and were arrested at the G/M phase. With time, cells proceeded to apoptosis, as revealed by increased amounts of cells with fragmented DNA and cleavage of caspase-8 and -9.

Six (8, 10, 12, 14, 19, and 26) of 23 compounds showed strong inhibitory activities against Topo-mediated DNA relaxation and proliferation of five human cell lines including breast (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7), colorectal (HCT116) and non-small cell lung (H1299) cancers. Among these, compounds 14 and 26 exhibited full inhibitory activities against Topo I at 3 μM and Topo IIα at 1 μM. Cancer cells treated with 26 accumulated DNA damage and were arrested at the G/M phase. With time, cells proceeded to apoptosis, as revealed by increased amounts of cells with fragmented DNA and cleavage of caspase-8 and -9. In contrast, normal breast epithelial cells showed low sensitivity to 26. Taken together, our study identifies 26 as a potent Topo dual-inhibitor with low toxicity to normal cells, and elucidates that the terminal amino group of N-2-aminoethylamino or N-3-aminopropylamino at the 6th position and 8,10-di-halogen substituents on thiochromeno[2,3-c]quinolin-12-one are critical for the Topo-inhibiting and cancer-killing activities.\n",

            "Title: Amides of pyrrole- and thiophene-fused anthraquinone derivatives: A role of the heterocyclic core in antitumor properties.  Abstract: Heteroarene-fused anthraquinone derivatives represent a class of perspective anticancer drug candidates capable of targeting multiple vital processes including drug resistance. Taking advantage of previously demonstrated potential of amide derivatives of heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein dissected the role of the heterocyclic core in antitumor properties. A new series of naphtho[2,3-f]indole-3- and anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-3-carboxamides was synthesized via coupling the respective acids with cyclic diamines. New compounds demonstrated a submicromolar antiproliferative potency close to doxorubicin (Dox) against five tumor cell lines of various tissue origin. In contrast to Dox, the new compounds were similarly cytotoxic for HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (wild type p53) and their isogenic p53 knockout counterparts. Modification of the heterocyclic core changed the targeting properties: the best-in-series naphtho[2,3-f]indole-3-carboxamide 8 formed more affine complexes with DNA duplex than furan and thiophene analogs, a property that can be translated into a stronger inhibition of topoisomerase 1 mediated DNA unwinding. At tolerable doses the water soluble derivative 8 significantly inhibited tumor growth (up to 79%) and increased the lifespan (153%) of mice bearing P388 lymphoma transplants. Together with better solubility for parenteral administration and well tolerance by animals of the indole derivative 8 indicates prospects for further search of new antitumor drug candidates among the heteroarene-fused anthraquinones.\n",

Abstract: Natural products (NPs) have played a crucial role in the discovery and development of antitumor drugs. However, the high structural complexity of NPs generally results in unfavorable physicochemical profiles and poor drug-likeness. A powerful strategy to tackle this obstacle is the structural simplification of NPs by truncating nonessential structures. Herein, a series of tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives were designed by elimination of the D ring of NP evodiamine. Structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of compound 45, which displayed highly potent antitumor activity against all the tested cancer cell lines and excellent in vivo antitumor activity in the HCT116 xenograft model with low toxicity. Further mechanistic research indicated that compound 45 acted by dual Top1/2 inhibition and induced caspase-dependent cell apoptosis coupled with G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest. This proof-of-concept study validated the effectiveness of structural simplification in NP-based drug development, discovered compound 45 as a potent antitumor lead compound and enriched the structure-activity relationships of evodiamine.\n",

Further mechanistic research indicated that compound 45 acted by dual Top1/2 inhibition and induced caspase-dependent cell apoptosis coupled with G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest. This proof-of-concept study validated the effectiveness of structural simplification in NP-based drug development, discovered compound 45 as a potent antitumor lead compound and enriched the structure-activity relationships of evodiamine.\n",

Abstract: A series of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives of lawsone (1), 6-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (2), and juglone (3) were synthesized by alkylation, acylation, and sulfonylation reactions. The yields of lawsone derivatives 1a-1k (type A), 6-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives 2a-2j (type B), and juglone derivatives 3a-3h (type C) were 52-99%, 53-96%, and 28-95%, respectively. All compounds were tested in vitro for the cytotoxicity against human oral epidermoid carcinoma (KB) and cervix epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa) cells and their structure-activity relationship was studied. Compound 3c was found to be most potent in KB cell line (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.39 µM). Some compounds were evaluated for DNA topoisomerase I inhibition. Compounds 2c, 3, 3a, and 3d showed topoisomerase inhibition activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.3-91 µM. Standard redox potentials (E°) of all naphthoquinones in phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 were examined by means of cyclic voltammetry. A definite correlation has been found between the redox potentials and inhibitory effects of type A compounds.\n",

Abstract: The anthraquinone scaffold has long been known as a source of efficacious antitumor drugs. In particular, the various chemical modifications of the side chains in this scaffold have yielded the compounds potent for the wild type tumor cells, their counterparts with molecular determinants of altered drug response, as well as in vivo settings. Further exploring the chemotype of anticancer heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein demonstrate that derivative of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, (compound 8) is highly potent against a panel of human tumor cell lines and their drug resistant variants. Treatment with submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations of 8 for only 30 min was sufficient to trigger lethal damage of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Compound 8 (2.5 μM, 3-6 h) induced an apoptotic cell death as determined by concomitant activation of caspases 3 and 9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, increase of Annexin V/propidium iodide double stained cells, DNA fragmentation (subG1 fraction) and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Neither a significant interaction with double stranded DNA nor strong inhibition of the DNA dependent enzyme topoisomerase 1 by 8 were detectable in cell free systems. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that some amount of 8 was detectable in mitochondria as early as 5 min after the addition to the cells; exposure for 1 h caused significant morphological changes and clustering of mitochondria. The bioisosteric analog 2 in which the thiophene ring was replaced with furan was less active although the patterns of cytotoxicity of both derivatives were similar. These results point at the specific role of the sulfur atom in the antitumor properties of carboxamide derivatives of heteroarene-fused anthraquinone.\n",

            "Title: Integration of a Diselenide Unit Generates Fluorogenic Camptothecin Prodrugs with Improved Cytotoxicity to Cancer Cells.  Abstract: A diselenide/disulfide unit was introduced into camptothecin (CPT), and two selenoprodrugs (e.g., CPT-Se3 and CPT-Se4) were identified to show improved potency in killing cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Interestingly, the intrinsic fluorescence of CPT was severely quenched by the diselenide bond. Both the selenoprodrugs were activated by glutathione with a nearly complete recovery of CPT's fluorescence. The activation of prodrugs was accompanied by the production of selenol intermediates, which catalyzed the constant conversion of glutathione and oxygen to oxidized glutathione and superoxides. The diselenide unit is widely employed in constructing thiol-responsive materials. However, the selenol intermediates were largely ignored in the activation process prior to this study. Our work verified that integration of the diselenide unit may further enhance the parent drug's efficacy. Also, the discovery of the fluorescence quenching property of the diselenide/disulfide bond further shed light on constructing novel theranostic agents.\n",

The crucial chemotherapy is mainly alkylating agents with modest clinical success. Given this desperate need and inspired by the encouraging results of a phase II trial via concomitant Topo I inhibitor plus COX-2 inhibitor, we designed a series of N-2-(phenylamino) benzamide derivatives as novel anti-glioblastoma agents based on structure modification on 1,5-naphthyridine derivatives (Topo I inhibitors). Notably, the target compounds I-1 (33.61 ± 1.15 μM) and I-8 (45.01 ± 2.37 μM) were confirmed to inhibit COX-2, while a previous reported compound (1,5-naphthyridine derivative) resulted nearly inactive towards COX-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 150 μM). Besides, I-1 and I-8 exhibited higher anti-proliferation, anti-migration, anti-invasion effects than the parent compound 1,5-naphthyridine derivative, suggesting the success of modification based on the parent. Moreover, I-1 obviously repressed tumor growth in the C6 glioma orthotopic model (TGI = 66.7%) and U87MG xenograft model (TGI = 69.4%). Besides, I-1 downregulated PGE<sub>2</sub>, VEGF, MMP-9, and STAT3 activation, upregulated E-cadherin in the orthotopic model.

Abstract: As a recently discovered DNA repair enzyme, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) removes topoisomerase IB (TOP1)-mediated DNA protein cross-links. Inhibiting TDP1 can potentiate the cytotoxicity of TOP1 inhibitors and overcome cancer cell resistance to TOP1 inhibitors. On the basis of our previous study, herein we report the synthesis of benzophenanthridinone derivatives as TOP1 and TDP1 inhibitors. Seven compounds (<b>C2</b>, <b>C4</b>, <b>C5</b>, <b>C7</b>, <b>C8</b>, <b>C12</b>, and <b>C14</b>) showed a robust TOP1 inhibitory activity (+++ or ++++), and four compounds (<b>A13</b>, <b>C12</b>, <b>C13</b>, and <b>C26</b>) showed a TDP1 inhibition (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 15 or 19 μM). We also show that the dual TOP1 and TDP1 inhibitor <b>C12</b> induces both cellular TOP1cc, TDP1cc formation and DNA damage, resulting in cancer cell apoptosis at a sub-micromolar concentration. In addition, <b>C12</b> showed an enhanced activity in drug-resistant MCF-7/TDP1 cancer cells and was synergistic with topotecan in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/TDP1 cells.\n",

Abstract: A series of novel 7-substituted 10,11-methylenedioxy-camptothecin (FL118) derivatives were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. All the FL118 analogues showed significant cytotoxic activities in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar range and were more potent than topotecan. The most active compound 9c exhibited more significant anti-tumor activity against small-cell lung cancer (NCI-H446, H69, drug-resistant H69AR cells, drug-resistant NCI-H446/Irinotecan cells and drug-resistant NCI-H446/EP cells) in vitro. Additionally, 9c could also induce the expression of apoptosis proteins such as caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP in small-cell lung cancer. Further studies showed that 9c induced apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, XIAP and survivin in small-cell lung cancer. In vivo9c also showed better anti-tumor efficacy, with the tumor growth inhibition rates were 40.4% (0.75 mg/kg), 73.7% (1.5 mg/kg), and 95.5% (3 mg/kg). It is noteworthy that 9c also demonstrated potent inhibition of drug-resistant tumor growth in NCI-H446/Irinotecan and NCI-H446/EP xenograft models, the tumor growth inhibition rates were 93.42% and 84.46%, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicated that compound 9c displays outstanding antitumor activity and drug-resistance in small-cell lung cancer both in vivo and in vitro, which could be worth further research as a novel anti-tumor drug against small-cell lung cancer.\n",

Abstract: 'Epigenetic' regulation of genes via post-translational modulation of proteins is the current mainstay approach for the disease therapies, particularly explored in the Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) class of enzymes. Mainly sight saw in cancer chemotherapeutics, HDAC inhibitors have also found a promising role in other diseases (neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infections) and successfully entered in various combination therapies (pre-clinical/clinical stages). The prevalent flexibility in the structural design of HDAC inhibitors makes them easily tuneable to merge with other pharmacophore modules for generating multi-targeted single hybrids as a novel tactic to overcome drawbacks of polypharmacy. Herein, we reviewed the putative role of prevalent HDAC hybrids inhibitors in the current and prospective stage as a translational approach to overcome the limitations of the existing conventional drug candidates (parent molecule) when used either alone (drug resistance, solubility issues, adverse side effects, selectivity profile) or in combination (pharmacokinetic interactions, patient compliance) for treating various diseases.\n",

Since the isolation of first β-carboline from Peganum harmala in 1841, the isolation and synthesis of various β-carboline derivatives surged in the following centuries. β-Carboline derivatives due to their widespread availability from natural sources, structural flexibility, quick reactivity and interaction with varied anticancer targets such as DNA (intercalation, groove binding, etc.), enzymes (GPX4, topoisomerases, kinases, etc.) and proteins (tubulin, ABCG2/BRCP1, etc.) have established themselves as promising lead compounds for the synthesis of various anticancer active agents. The current review covers the synthesis and isolation, anticancer activity, mechanism of action and SAR of various β-carboline containing molecules, its derivatives and congeners.\n",

            "Title: Design, synthesis and anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity of 3-arylisoquinoline alkaloids.  Abstract: This article describes the syntheses and biological activity of five 3-arylisoquinoline natural products corydamine (1), N-formyl Corydamine (2), hypecumine (3), Decumbenine B (XW) and 2-(1,3-dioxolo [4,5-h]isoquinolin-7-yl)-4,5-dimethoxy-N-methyl-Benzeneethanamine (A), and twelve analogues. Among them, 1, 2, and A were synthesized for the first time. In vitro screening for anti-proliferative activity showed that derivative 1a could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.82 μM on Huh7 cells and 6.83 μM on LM9 cells), and arrest cell cycle at G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. The mechanistic studies further suggested compound 1a was a dual inhibitor of Topo I and Topo II, and Topo II inhibitory activity was superior to etoposide. In addition, 1a could significantly inhibit the invasion and migration of cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9, and induce apoptosis through inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated 1a could obviously reduce the growth of xenograft tumor and possessed good pharmacokinetic parameters, which indicated the potential value of 1a in treating liver cancer.\n",

            "Title: Development of oxoisoaporphine derivatives with topoisomerase I inhibition and reversal of multidrug resistance in breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells.  Abstract: A series of oxoisoaporphine derivatives with topoisomerase I inhibition and cytotoxic activities. Among them, compound 14 showed the most potent cytotoxic activity against all cancer cell lines tested, and substantially lower cytotoxicity to LO2 cells. Molecular docking studies, dynamics simulation and a follow-up enzyme inhibition assay indicated that 14 could interfere with DNA and significantly inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I. Further mechanistic studies revealed that 14 could arrest cell cycle at the G1 phase, and finally killed MCF-7 cells via apoptosis. In addition, 14 exhibited remarkable chemoreversal ability on multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells. Some of its mechanisms may be related to inhibition of MCF-7/ADR P-gp-mediated Rhodamine (Rh123) efflux function and expression level, as well as inhibition of ROS, increase of ADR accumulation in MCF7/ADR cells, and enhancement of ADR in inducing apoptosis of MCF7/ADR cells. As 14 has little toxic and side effects, it may have the potential for further research.\n",

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.', 'Title: Inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 helicase-primase by (dichloroanilino)purines and -pyrimidines.  Abstract: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) encodes a heterotrimeric helicase-primase comprised of the products of three of the seven DNA replication-specific genes. Several dihalo-substituted derivatives of N2-phenylguanines and 2-anilinoadenines weakly inhibited the intrinsic DNA-dependent NTPase activity of the HSV1 helicase-primase, and these compounds inhibited the DNA-unwinding activity of the enzyme. The primase activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by 3,4- and 3,5-dichloroanilino derivatives of adenine and 2-aminopyrimidines. These compounds and nucleoside analogs of 2-(3,5-dichloroanilino)purines inhibited viral DNA synthesis in HSV1-infected HeLa cells in culture but also inhibited cellular DNA synthesis, likely as a result of inhibition of cellular primase and/or DNA polymerases.', 'Title: Inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 helicase-primase by (dichloroanilino)purines and -pyrimidines.

Abstract: A model of molecular diversity is presented. The model, termed \"Quantized Surface Complementarity Diversity\" (QSCD), defines molecular diversity by measuring molecular complementarity to a fully enumerated set of theoretical target surfaces. Molecular diversity space is defined as the molecular complement to this set of enumerated surfaces. Using a set of known test compounds, the model is shown to be biologically relevant, consistently scoring known actives as similar. At the resolution of the model, which examines molecules \"quantized\" into 4.24 A cubic units and treats four points of specific energetic complementarity, the minimum number of compounds needed to fully cover molecular diversity space up to volume 1070 cubic A is estimated to be on the order of 24 million molecules. Most importantly, QSCD allows for individual points in diversity space to be filled by direct modeling of molecular libraries into detailed 3D templates of shape and functionality.', 'Title: Synthesis of water-soluble (aminoalkyl)camptothecin analogues: inhibition of topoisomerase I and antitumor activity.  Abstract: Water-soluble analogues of the antitumor alkaloid camptothecin (1) were prepared in which aminoalkyl groups were introduced into ring A or B. Most of the analogues were prepared by oxidation of camptothecin to 10-hydroxycamptothecin (2) followed by a Mannich reaction to give N-substituted 9-(aminomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins (4-12) or by subsequent modification of Mannich product 4 (13, 15, 17, 19, 21). Others were obtained by modification of the hydroxyl group of 2 (25,26) or by total synthesis (35,42,43). These analogues, as well as some of their synthetic precursors, were evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I, cytotoxicity, and antitumor activity. Although there was not a quantitative correlation between these assays, compounds that inhibited topoisomerase I were also cytotoxic and demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo. Further evaluation of the most active water-soluble analogue led to the selection of 9-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-10-hydroxycamptothecin (4, SK&F 104864) for development as an antitumor agent. In addition to its water solubility, ease of synthesis from natural camptothecin, and high potency, 4 demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in preclinical tumor models and is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.', 'Title: Modification of the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin: inhibition of mammalian topoisomerase I and biological activity.  Abstract: Several camptothecin derivatives containing a modified hydroxy lactone ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Each of the groups of the hydroxy lactone moiety, the carbonyl oxygen, the ring lactone oxygen, and the 20-hydroxy group, were shown to be critical for enzyme inhibition. For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex. With a few exceptions, those compounds that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action. One of these compounds was tested for antitumor activity and was found to be inactive. The present findings, as well as other reports that the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin is critical for antitumor activity in vivo, correlate with the structure-activity relationships at the level of topoisomerase I and support the hypothesis that antitumor activity is related to inhibition of this target enzyme.', 'Title: Modification of the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin: inhibition of mammalian topoisomerase I and biological activity.  Abstract: Several camptothecin derivatives containing a modified hydroxy lactone ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Each of the groups of the hydroxy lactone moiety, the carbonyl oxygen, the ring lactone oxygen, and the 20-hydroxy group, were shown to be critical for enzyme inhibition. For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex. With a few exceptions, those compounds that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action.

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.', 'Title: Water soluble inhibitors of topoisomerase I: quaternary salt derivatives of camptothecin.  Abstract: Eleven water soluble 7-substituted quaternary ammonium salt derivatives of 10,11-(methylenedioxy)- and 10,11-(ethylenedioxy)-(20S)-camptothecin were synthesized via the Friedlander reaction followed by nucleophilic displacement with an aromatic amine. All of these compounds were more potent than camptothecin in the in vitro cleavable complex assay. These inherently charged camptothecin derivatives were cytotoxic against three different human tumor cell lines (SKOV3, an ovarian adenocarcinoma; SKVLB a multidrug resistant ovarian adenocarcinoma; and HT-29, a colon carcinoma).

The solubilities of compounds 6 and 7 were measured to be 4.5 and 5.8 mg/mL, respectively, in pH 5 acetate buffer in contrast to < 0.003 mg/mL for camptothecin in the same buffer. In the purified topoisomerase I cleavable complex enzyme assay, compounds 6 and 7 demonstrated potent inhibition of topoisomerase I with IC50's of 300 and 416 nM, respectively, in comparison to 679 nM for camptothecin and 1028 nM for topotecan.

Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type one integrase (HIV-1 integrase) is required for integration of a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into a host chromosome and for HIV replication. We have previously reported that phenolic moieties in compounds such as flavones, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), tyrphostins, and curcumin confer inhibitory activity against HIV-1 integrase. We have investigated the actions of several recently described protease inhibitors, possessing novel structural features, on HIV-1 integrase. NSC 158393, which contains four 4-hydroxycoumarin residues, was found to exhibit antiviral, antiprotease, and antiintegrase activity. Both the DNA binding and catalytic activities (3'-processing and strand transfer) of integrase were inhibited at micromolar concentrations. Disintegration catalyzed by an integrase mutant containing only the central catalytic domain was also inhibited, indicating that the binding site for these compounds resides in the central 50-212 amino acids of HIV-1 integrase. Binding at or near the integrase catalytic site was also suggested by a global inhibition of the choice of attacking nucleophile in the 3'-processing reaction. NSC 158393 inhibited HIV-2, feline, and simian immunodeficiency virus integrases while eukaryotic topoisomerase I was inhibited at higher concentrations, suggesting selective inhibition of retroviral integrases. Molecular modeling studies revealed that the two hydroxyls and two carbonyl moieties in NSC 158393 may represent essential elements of the pharmacophore. Antiviral efficacy was observed with NSC 158393 derivatives that inhibited both HIV protease and integrase, and the most potent integrase inhibitors also inhibited HIV protease. Hydroxycoumarins may provide lead compounds for development of novel antiviral agents based upon the concurrent inhibition of two viral targets, HIV-1 integrase and protease.\", 'Title: Synthesis, topoisomerase I inhibition and structure-activity relationship study of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridine derivatives.  Abstract: For the development of new anticancer agents, phenyl, 2-pyridyl, 2-furyl, 2-thienyl, 2-furylvinyl and 2-thienylvinyl substituted derivatives on 2,4,6-position in pyridine moiety were prepared and evaluated for their topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Among the thirteen prepared compounds, four compounds exhibited strong topoisomerase I inhibitory activity.

Abstract: A series of analogs based on a novel template, 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin, were obtained from total synthesis and tested as potential anticancer drugs in the topoisomerase I enzyme cleavable complex assay. The parent compound 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin (8) was derived from a Friedlander condensation between the known aminopyridine derivative 3-(3-amino-4-picolylidene)-p-toluidine and optically active tricyclic ketone 7. Compound 8 had activity approximately twice that of (20S)-camptothecin in the calf thymus topoisomerase I cleavable complex assay. Compounds were prepared wherein the 11-aza nitrogen atom was quaternized as either the corresponding N-oxide or methyl iodide. Compounds with quaternized N-11 showed improved water solubility and were equipotent to the clinically investigated camptothecin analog topotecan in the cleavable complex assay. These compounds were evaluated in vivo in nude mice bearing HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenografts. The analog 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin 11-N-oxide was found to significantly retard tumor growth when compared to untreated controls. Finally, 7,10-disubstituted 11-azacamptothecin analogs were synthesized using Pd(0) coupling reactions of 10-bromo-7-alkyl-11-aza-(20S)-camptothecins 19 and 20, which in turn were available from a Friedlander condensation of the novel bromopyridine derivatives 17a and 17b with 7. Among the 10-substituted series, a number of analogs displayed extremely high in vitro potency against topoisomerase I and improved aqueous solubility. A significant number of the compounds were found to be active in whole cell cytotoxicity assays and several were evaluated in nude mice bearing the HT-29 tumor xenografts.

Abstract: A series of compounds structurally related to staurosporine, rebeccamycin, and corresponding aglycones was synthesized, and their activities toward protein kinase C and topoisomerases I and II were tested together with their in vitro antitumor efficiency against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. Their antimicrobial activities were also examined against a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), a yeast (Candida albicans), and three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Streptomyces chartreusis, and Streptomyces griseus). To avoid side effects expected with protein kinase C inhibitors, we introduced substitution on the maleimide nitrogen and/or a sugar moiety linked to one of the indole nitrogens to obtain specific inhibitors of topoisomerase I with minimal activities on protein kinase C. As expected, these structures were inefficient on topoisomerase II, and some of them exhibited a strong activity against topoisomerase I. Generally, dechlorinated compounds were found to be more active than chlorinated analogues against both purified topoisomerase I and protein kinase C. On the other hand, opposite results were obtained in the cell antiproliferative assays. These results suggest lack of cell membrane permeability in the absence of the chlorine residue or cleavage of carbon-chlorine bonds inside the cell.', 'Title: Syntheses and biological activities of rebeccamycin analogues. Introduction of a halogenoacetyl substituent.  Abstract: In the course of structure-activity relationships on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing a halogenoacetyl substituent were synthesized with the expectation of increasing the interaction with DNA, possibly via covalent reaction with the double helix. Two rebeccamycin analogues bearing an acetyl instead of a bromoacetyl substituent were prepared to gain an insight into the role of the halogen atom. The new compounds show very little effect on protein kinase C and no covalent reaction with DNA was detected. However, the drugs behave as typical topoisomerase I poisons, and they are significantly more toxic toward P388 leukemia cells than to P388/CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. The introduction of a bromo- or chloro-acetyl substituent does not affect the capacity of the drug to interfere with topoisomerase I either in vitro or in cells. One of the bromoacetyl derivatives, compound 8, is the most cytotoxic rebeccamycin derivative among the hundred of derivatives we have synthesized to date. In addition, we determined the antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, and against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The effect of the drugs on Candida albicans yeast growth and their anti-HIV-1 activities were also measured.', \"Title: Substituted 2,5'-Bi-1H-benzimidazoles: topoisomerase I inhibition and cytotoxicity.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a novel class of topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors that are cytotoxic in cancer cell cultures and are therefore under development as potential anticancer agents. As inhibitors of the DNA religation reaction occurring after DNA cleavage by the enzyme, they are classified as top1 poisons, similar to the camptothecins. Two strategies were employed in order to further develop the structure-activity relationships of the indenoisoquinolines and enhance their therapeutic potential. The first strategy involved the synthesis of indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrid molecules to take advantage of a proposed structural analogy between the indenoisoquinolines and camptothecin. The desired hybrids were synthesized by reaction of halogenated phthalides with a dihydropyrroloquinoline. The second strategy involved the attachment of various alkenyl substituents to the C-11 position of the indenoisoquinolines, which were assumed to project into the DNA minor groove. The required C-11-substituted indenoisoquinolines were synthesized by McMurry reactions of 11-ketoindenoisoquinolines with aldehydes, and the geometries of the resulting alkenes were established by nuclear Overhauser effect difference NMR spectroscopy. All of the new indenoisoquinolines were examined for cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures as well as for activity vs top1. Although the indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrid molecules proved to be less cytotoxic and displayed less activity against top1, an analogue incorporating a 3'-aminoalkenyl substituent at the C-11 position of the indenoisoquinoline system was significantly more potent than the prototype indenoisoquinoline in both assays. These results indicate that C-11 aminoalkyl substituents that are assumed to project into the minor groove enhance the cytotoxicity and top1 inhibitory activity of the parent indenoisoquinoline system.\", \"Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of cytotoxic 11-alkenylindenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors and indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrids.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a novel class of topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors that are cytotoxic in cancer cell cultures and are therefore under development as potential anticancer agents.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a class of noncamptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors that display significant cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures. They offer a number of potential advantages over the camptothecins, including greater chemical stability, formation of more persistent cleavage complexes, and induction of a unique pattern of DNA cleavage sites. Molecular modeling has suggested that substituents on the indenoisoquinoline lactam nitrogen would protrude out of the DNA duplex in the ternary cleavage complex through the major groove. This indicates that relatively large substituents in that location would be tolerated without compromising biological activity. As a strategy for increasing the potencies and potential therapeutic usefulness of the indenoisoquinolines, a series of compounds was synthesized containing polyamine side chains on the lactam nitrogen. The rationale for the synthesis of these compounds was that the positively charged ammonium cations would increase DNA affinity through electrostatic binding to the negatively charged DNA backbone, and the polyamines might also facilitate cellular uptake by utilization of polyamine transporters. The key step in the synthesis involved the condensation of Schiff bases, containing protected amine side chains, with substituted homophthalic anhydrides, to afford cis-3-aryl-4-carboxy-1-isoquinolones. These isoquinolones were then converted to indenoisoquinolines with thionyl chloride. Although monoamines were much more potent than the lead compound, no significant increase in potency was observed through incorporation of additional amino groups in the side chain. However, one of the monoamine analogues, which features a bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group in the side chain, proved to be one of the most cytotoxic indenoisoquinoline synthesized to date, with a GI50 mean-graph midpoint (MGM) of 0.07 microM in the NIH human cancer cell culture screen, and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity comparable to that of camptothecin.', 'Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors featuring polyamine side chains on the lactam nitrogen.

Abstract: In an attempt to design and synthesize potential anticancer agents acting by inhibition of topoisomerase I (top1), a new series of indenoisoquinolines was prepared and tested for cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures and for activity against top1. The synthesis relied on the condensation of substituted Schiff bases with homophthalic anhydrides to produce cis-3-aryl-4-carboxyisoquinolones that were cyclized to indenoisoquinolines in the presence of thionyl chloride.

A number of structurally related indenoisoquinolines were also obtained that had both potent cytotoxicity as well as top1 inhibitory activity. The key feature of the more potent compounds was the presence of an aminoalkyl side chain on the indenoisoquinoline nitrogen atom. The DNA cleavage patterns induced by top1 in the presence of the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin. Some of the cleavage sites induced by the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin, and conversely, camptothecin induced unique cleavage sites not apparent with the indenoisoquinolines. However, both camptothecin and the indenoisoquinolines also induced DNA cleavage sites that were the same in both series but varied in intensity. In addition, some of the DNA cleavages seen with the free base of 19a (compound 18c) in the presence of top1 were inhibited at higher drug concentrations, suggesting either a direct inhibition of the enzyme or an alternative mechanism involving DNA intercalation.

Abstract: In an attempt to design and synthesize potential anticancer agents acting by inhibition of topoisomerase I (top1), a new series of indenoisoquinolines was prepared and tested for cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures and for activity against top1. The synthesis relied on the condensation of substituted Schiff bases with homophthalic anhydrides to produce cis-3-aryl-4-carboxyisoquinolones that were cyclized to indenoisoquinolines in the presence of thionyl chloride. Both top1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity maximized in a single compound, 6-[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminopropyl]-5,6-dihydro-2,3-dimethoxy-8, 9-methylenedioxy-5,11-dioxo-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline hydrochloride (19a), which proved to be a very potent top1 inhibitor having a 110 nM mean graph midpoint (MGM) when tested for cytotoxicity in 55 human cancer cell cultures. A number of structurally related indenoisoquinolines were also obtained that had both potent cytotoxicity as well as top1 inhibitory activity. The key feature of the more potent compounds was the presence of an aminoalkyl side chain on the indenoisoquinoline nitrogen atom. The DNA cleavage patterns induced by top1 in the presence of the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin.

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.', 'Title: Indolocarbazole poisons of human topoisomerase I: regioisomeric analogues of ED-110.  Abstract: All four \"symmetrical\" regioisomers of ED-110, an indolocarbazole derivative having potent activity against human topoisomerase I (Topo I) were synthesized. The isomer containing hydroxyl groups in the 3- and 9-positions was approximately ten-fold more active against Topo I, and 5- to 35-fold more active against human solid tumor cell lines in vitro, relative to ED-110.', \"Title: Acylshikonin analogues: synthesis and inhibition of DNA topoisomerase-I.  Abstract: Compounds bearing an acyl group of a various size at 1'-OH of shikonin were synthesized as acyl analogues of shikonin, which was isolated from the root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, and evaluated for inhibitory effect on topoisomerase-I activity. A selective acylation at 1'-OH of shikonin in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine gave rise to a good yield of corresponding acylshikonin derivatives. In general, analogues with an acyl group of shorter chain lengths (C2-C6) exerted a stronger inhibitory action than those with longer chain lengths (C7-C20). While the halogen substitution at C-2 of the acetyl moiety failed to increase the inhibitory potency, the placement of double bonds in the acyl group (C5-C7) augmented the potency remarkably. Of the 32 derivatives evaluated, 15 compounds exhibited a higher inhibitory effect than shikonin. Noteworthy, the inhibitory potency of acetylshikonin, propanoylshikonin, and 4-pentenoylshikonin was approximately 4-fold greater than that of camptothecin. All these data suggest that the size of acyl moiety is important for the enhancement of potency, and the presence of olefinic double bonds is also beneficial.\", 'Title: Antitumor agents. 166.

Abstract: 5H-8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxydibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one exhibits potent TOP1-targeting activity and pronounced antitumor activity. It was hypothesized that replacement of the two methoxyl groups with a nitro substituent would allow for retention of similar activity.

Abstract: Homocamptothecin (hCPT) is an E-ring modified camptothecin (CPT) analogue bearing a methylene spacer between the alcohol and carboxyl functions of the CPT lactone. Combining pronounced inhibitory activity of topoisomerase I (Topo I) with enhanced plasma stability, hCPT constitutes an attractive template for the elaboration of new anticancer agents. Fluorinated hCPT analogues, prepared in enantiomerically pure form, were assayed by their stimulation of Topo I-mediated DNA cleavage. Translation into cytotoxicity against tumor cells was evaluated on HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma and on the multidrug resistant lung and bladder tumor cell lines, A549 and T24r. Good correlation is observed between the ability of the drugs to stimulate Topo I-mediated DNA cleavage and the respective 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50) values) of the HT29, A549, and T24r cell growth. Fluorine substitution in the A-ring of hCPT was found to have a pronounced influence on biological activity, providing several compounds which are up to 100-fold more potent than CPT in terms of IC(50).

Abstract: Camptothecin (1), a potent antitumor alkaloid, is known to inhibit topoisomerase I, an enzyme that relaxes supercoiled DNA. Modifications have been made to the B, D, and E rings of this natural product. Specifically, compounds 2-10 either have an ester moiety in place of the E ring lactone, a methyl ester attached to position 14, a saturated (or nonexistent) deaza B ring, or contain a combination of these permutations. We have conducted in vitro assays against the topoisomerase I relaxation reaction which verify the necessity for a lactone in the E ring. Furthermore, steric requirements at position 14 are shown to be crucial for activity, and planarity of the A and B rings of camptothecin is also implicated in the ability of the drug to inhibit topoisomerase I.

Some of the DNA cleavage sites detected in the presence of the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with the camptothecins. The cleavage sites induced by the indenoisoquinolines were reversed by salt treatment, which is consistent with the reversible trapping of top1 cleavable complexes by the indenoisoquinolines. In general, the potencies of the indenoisoquinolines as top1 inhibitors did not correlate with their potencies as cytotoxic agents, as some of the most cytotoxic agents had little if any effect on top1.

Abstract: Homocamptothecin (hCPT), a camptothecin (CPT) analogue with a seven membered beta-hydroxylactone which combines enhanced plasma stability and potent topoisomerase I (Topo I)-mediated activity, is an attractive template for the elaboration of new anticancer agents. Like CPT, hCPT carries an asymmetric tertiary alcohol and displays stereoselective inhibition of Topo I. The preparation and biological screening of racemic hCPT analogues are described. The 10 hCPTs tested were better Topo I inhibitors than CPT. Fluorinated hCPTs 23c, d,f,g were found to have potent cytotoxic activity on A427 and PC-3 tumor cell lines. Their cytotoxicity remained high on the K562adr and MCF7mdr cell lines, which overexpress a functionally active P-glycoprotein. Fluorinated hCPTs were more efficacious in vivo than CPT on HT-29 xenografts. In this model, a tumor growth delay of 25 days was reached with hCPT 23g at a daily dose of 0.32 mg/kg, compared to 4 days with CPT at 0.625 mg/kg. Thus difluorinated hCPT 23g warrants further investigation as a novel Topo I inhibitor with high cytotoxicity toward tumor cells and promising in vivo efficacy.', 'Title: Modification of the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin: inhibition of mammalian topoisomerase I and biological activity.  Abstract: Several camptothecin derivatives containing a modified hydroxy lactone ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Each of the groups of the hydroxy lactone moiety, the carbonyl oxygen, the ring lactone oxygen, and the 20-hydroxy group, were shown to be critical for enzyme inhibition. For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex. With a few exceptions, those compounds that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action. One of these compounds was tested for antitumor activity and was found to be inactive. The present findings, as well as other reports that the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin is critical for antitumor activity in vivo, correlate with the structure-activity relationships at the level of topoisomerase I and support the hypothesis that antitumor activity is related to inhibition of this target enzyme.', 'Ability (200 uM) to satbilize DNA-topoisomerase (from calf) I-compound ternary complex was determined; not active', 'Ability to satbilize DNA-topoisomerase (from calf) I-compound ternary complex was determined', 'Ability to inhibit calf thymus topoisomerase I when assayed in the cleavable complex formation', 'Compound was evaluated for in vitro percent inhibition of purified calf thymus topoisomerase I at 100 uM', 'Title: Syntheses and biological activities (topoisomerase inhibition and antitumor and antimicrobial properties) of rebeccamycin analogues bearing modified sugar moieties and substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group.  Abstract: As a part of studies on structure-activity relationships, several potential topoisomerase I inhibitors were prepared. Different analogues of the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group were synthesized. These compounds bore either the sugar residue of rebeccamycin, with or without the chlorine atoms on the indole moieties, or modified sugar residues (galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, or fucopyranosyl) linked to the aglycone via a beta- or alpha-N-glycosidic bond. Their inhibitory properties toward protein kinase C, topoisomerase I, and topoisomerase II were examined, and their DNA-binding properties were investigated. Their in vitro antitumor activities against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells were determined. Their antimicrobial activities were tested against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, and yeast Candida albicans. These compounds are inactive toward topoisomerase II but inhibit topoisomerase I. A substitution with a methyl group on the imide nitrogen led to a loss of proteine kinase C inhibition in the maleimide indolocarbazole series but did not prevent topoisomerase I inhibition. Compounds possessing a beta-N-glycosidic bond, which fully intercalated into DNA, were more efficient at inhibiting topoisomerase I than their analogues with an alpha-N-glycosidic bond; however, both were equally toxic toward P388 leukemia cells. Dechlorinated rebeccamycin possessing a methyl group on the imide nitrogen was about 10 times more efficient in terms of cytotoxicity and inhibition of topoisomerase I than the natural metabolite.', 'Title: Synthesis and evaluation of new 6-amino-substituted benzo[c]phenanthridine derivatives.  Abstract: Different 7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[c]phenanthridin-6(5H)-ones (10a-e) were prepared by using a one-pot procedure which includes the preparation of various 6- and 7-alkoxy-1-naphthylisocyanates from 1-naphthylamines and triphosgene, followed by addition of 1-N-morpholino-1-cyclohexenes, and cyclization of the resulting amides upon heating in the presence of hydrogen chloride. Subsequent aromatization, chlorination, and substitution with (dimethylamino)alkylamines, followed by a demethylation or a selective desisopropylation, allowed us to synthesize the derivatives 6a-i and 7a-h bearing a [(dimethylamino)alkyl]amino side chain at their 6-position. These compounds, as the other analogs 5a-b, were devised to further study the structure-activity relationships in the benzo[c]phenanthridine family of antitumor alkaloids led by fagaronine (1a) and nitidine (1b). Topoisomerases I and II cleavable complex assay and evaluation of the cytotoxicity and antitumor properties were performed. In vitro cytotoxicity (L1210 and Calc 18) shows a relationship between the cytotoxicity of these compounds and their topoisomerase poisoning properties. However, all these compounds were devoid of significant antitumor effect on the P388 murine leukemia system.', 'Title: Plant antitumor agents. 30. Synthesis and structure activity of novel camptothecin analogs.  Abstract: A large number of camptothecin (CPT) analogs have been prepared in the 20S, 20RS, and 20R configurations with a number of ring A substituents. Topoisomerase I (T-I) inhibition data (IC50) have been obtained by standard procedures. In general, substitution at the 9 or 10 positions with amino, halogeno, or hydroxyl groups in compounds with 20S configuration results in compounds with enhanced T-I inhibition. Compounds in the 20RS configuration were less active in vitro and in vivo and those in the 20R configuration were inactive.

Abstract: The present studies provide a three-dimensional model for the postulated ternary cleavable complex of topoisomerase I (top1), DNA, and camptothecin (CPT). Molecular simulations were done using the AMBER force field. The results suggest that a ternary cleavable complex might be stabilized by several hydrogen bonds in the binding site. In this proposed \"drug-stacking\" model, CPT is pseudointercalated in the top1-linked DNA cleavage site and interacts with the protein near its catalytic tyrosine through hydrogen bonding and stacking. The structural model is consistent with the following experimental observations: (i) the N3 position of the 5\\' terminal purine of the cleaved DNA strand is readily alkylated by 7-chloromethyl 10,11-methylenedioxy CPT; (ii) CPT generally tolerates substituents at positions 7, 9, and 10 but is inactivated by additions at position 12; (iii) 10,11-methylenedioxy (MDO) CPT is much more potent than 10,11-dimethoxy (DMO) CPT; (iv) the lactone portion of CPT is essential for top1 inhibitory activity; (v) 20S derivatives of CPT are much more potent than the 20R analogues; (vi) a catalytic tyrosine hydroxyl in top1 covalently links to the 3\\' terminal base, T, of the cleaved DNA strand; and (vii) top1 mutation Asn722Ser leads to CPT resistance.

Abstract: A series of 10 indolocarbazole derivatives, analogues to the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin, bearing modifications at the imide heterocycle were synthesized. They bear an N-methyl imide, N-methyl amide, or anhydride function instead of the original imide. Their inhibitory potencies toward topoisomerase I were examined using a DNA relaxation assay and by analyzing the drug-induced cleavage of 32P-labeled DNA. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition and interaction with DNA were also studied together with the in vitro antiproliferative activities against B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. The antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis), a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a yeast (Candida albicans) were tested as well as their antiviral activities toward HIV-1. The efficiency of the anhydride compounds was compared to that of the parent compound rebeccamycin and its dechlorinated analogue. All the compounds studied were inactive against PKC. The structural requirements for PKC and topoisomerase I inhibition are markedly different. In sharp contrast with the structure-PKC inhibition relationships, we found that an anhydride function does not affect topoisomerase I inhibition, whereas a methyl group on the indole nitrogen prevents the poisoning of topoisomerase I. The compounds exhibiting a marked toxicity to P388 leukemia cells had little or no effect on the growth of P388CPT5 cells which are resistant to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. This study reinforces the conclusion that the DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complex is the primary cellular target of the indolocarbazoles and significantly contributes to their cytotoxicity and possibly to their weak but noticeable anti-HIV-1 activities. The structure-activity relationships are also discussed.', 'Title: Terbenzimidazoles: influence of 2\"-, 4-, and 5-substituents on cytotoxicity and relative potency as topoisomerase I poisons.  Abstract: Terbenzimidazoles poison the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I and possess significant cytotoxic activity against several human tumor cell lines. The relative pharmacological activity of 4,5- and 5,6-benzoterbenzimidazoles was compared to that of 5-phenylterbenzimidazole (3). 5,6-Benzoterbenzimidazole is inactive as a topoisomerase I poison and did not exhibit significant cytotoxic activity. In contrast, 4,5-benzoterbenzimidazole retained activity as a topoisomerase I poison but exhibited weak cytotoxic activity relative to 3. While 5-(1-naphthyl)terbenzimidazole is less potent than 3 as a topoisomerase I poison and cytotoxic agent, 5-(2-naphthyl)-terbenzimidazole has comparable activity to 3. The presence of a p-methoxy or p-chloro substituent on the phenyl moiety did not dramatically alter the pharmacological activity of 3. Several analogs of 3 were synthesized wherein the 2\"-substituent varied from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, phenyl to p-methoxyphenyl. Evaluation of the intrinsic activity of these analogs as topoisomerase I poisons indicates that topoisomerase I poisoning was not diminished by the presence of a methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl substituent at the 2\"-position. Among the various 2\"-substituted analogs evaluated, only in the case of 2\"-(p-methoxyphenyl)-5-phenylterbenzimidazole was a significant decrease in cytotoxicity observed.', \"Title: Heterocyclic bibenzimidazole derivatives as topoisomerase I inhibitors.

All 16 compounds tested, 14 conjugates plus two functionalized camptothecin controls, inhibit topoisomerase I in the concentration range 1.12-16.6 microM that divide into three distinct categories based on activity. The most active enzyme inhibitors belong to structure class A with either cationic dimethylaminium or neutral amide end groups. Generally class B conjugates are less effective in inhibiting topoisomerase I. Cytotoxic potencies of the drugs was tested against four representative human tumor cell lines: SKOV3, SKLVB, HT29, and KB. All 16 drugs gave measurable IC50 values against the KB cell line and fell into two categories with IC50 values of 0.049-0.66 microM (largely structure class B) and 1.0-48 microM (largely class A). Thus the class B conjugates, while less potent against the enzyme, contain two of the most potent drugs, 38 and 39, against KB cell lines. In contrast, in the case of the cell lines SKOV3 and HT29 there was a general correlation between the better topoisomerase inhibitors and their cell cytotoxicities.', 'Concentration required to inhibit 50% relaxation of 250 ng of SV40 DNA obtained with 0.5 I.U topoisomerase I at 37 degrees C for 30 min', 'Compound was tested for the inhibition of Topoisomerase I when administered at a dose of 25 ug/mL', 'Title: Antitumor agents. 185.

Abstract: Several 1,2,3-tridemethyldeacetylthiocolchicine derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against various human tumor cell lines and for their inhibitory effects on DNA topoisomerases in vitro. Exhaustive demethylation of thiocolchicine analogues completely changes their biological profiles. Instead of displaying antitubulin activity, most target compounds inhibited topoisomerase II activity. Only compounds with a larger side chain, such as 15a, 23a, and 24a, did not interfere with topoisomerase II enzymatic functions. The cytotoxicity of target compounds was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude compared to that of colchicine in most cell lines. The hydrophilicity of phenolic compounds might prevent drug passage through the cell plasma membrane and, thus, be responsible for the relatively weak cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, 27-30 were prepared from 16a by protecting all hydroxy groups with esters with an aim to facilitate drug transportation. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicated that 27 was more potent than its parent compound in all tested tumor cell lines and showed tissue selective cytotoxicity with a significant inhibitory effect against KB cells (IC50 = 2.7 microg/mL).

Abstract: Bromo analogues of the natural metabolite rebeccamycin with and without a methyl substituent on the imide nitrogen were synthesized. The effects of the drugs on protein kinase C, the binding to DNA, and the effect on topoisomerase I were determined. The drugs' uptake and their antiproliferative activities against P388 leukemia cells sensitive and resistant to camptothecin, their antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium (B. cereus), and their anti-HIV-1 activity were measured and compared to those of the chlorinated and dechlorinated analogues. Dibrominated imide 5 shows a remarkable activity against topoisomerase I, affecting both the kinase and DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme. The marked cytotoxic potency of this compound depends essentially on its capacity to inhibit topoisomerase I.\", 'Title: Synthesis and antitumor activity of ring A- and F-modified hexacyclic camptothecin analogues.  Abstract: Nineteen ring A- and F-modified hexacyclic analogues of camptothecin were synthesized by Friedländer condensation of appropriately substituted bicyclic amino ketones with tricyclic ketone and were evaluated for cytotoxicity and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Seventeen of the compounds showed cytotoxic effects comparable or superior to those of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) against mouse leukemia P388 and human tumor cell lines HOC-21 and QG-56. Introduction of a compact and inductively electron-withdrawing substituent such as a hydroxy, methoxy, chloro, or fluoro group into position 5 of ring A of the hexacyclic compound remarkably increased the antitumor activity. The potency of topoisomerase I inhibition of these compounds showed good correlation with their cytotoxicity. Among them, the 4-methyl-5-fluoro hexacyclic compound was the most potent of all and was 10 times as active as SN-38 in in vitro antitumor activity.', 'Title: Inhibition of topoisomerase I by anthracycline antibiotics: evidence for general inhibition of topoisomerase I by DNA-binding agents.

Abstract: Isoaurostatin A (IAS-A) isolated from Thermomonospora alba showed weak inhibition against topoisomerase (topo) I (IC(50)=307microM). To get more strong inhibition, derivatives of IAS-A were prepared and their structure-activity relationships against topo I and II were investigated. The addition of hydroxyl group on aromatic rings increased the activities, 3-(3,4,5-trihydroxybenzylidene)-5-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one (IAS-9) showed strong inhibition (IC(50)=3microM) against topo I. And also, the increasing of hydroxyl group increased growth inhibition against a variety of cancer cells, and IAS-9 showed most potent inhibition. Unlike camptothecin and etoposide, IAS-9 neither stabilized DNA-topo cleavable complex nor intercalated into DNA, and it inhibited topo I and II noncompetitively.

These studies were extended to include 6-substituted 8,9-dimethoxy-2,3-methylenedioxy-dibenzo[c,h][2,6]naphthyridin-5-ones, which represent reversed lactam analogues of 1. Several of these analogues retained the potent TOP1-targeting activity and cytotoxicity observed for ARC-111.', 'Title: Camptothecin analogs with bulky, hydrophobic substituents at the 7-position via a Grignard reaction.  Abstract: By developing a new synthetic procedure for introduction of side chains onto the camptothecin ring system, we were able to achieve the preparation of a number of analogs bearing bulky, hydrophobic groups directly attached to the 7-position. These include 7-tert-butylcamptothecin, 7-benzylcamptothecin and the corresponding 10,11-methylenedioxycamptothecins. This method involves the reaction of an appropriate orthoaminobenzonitrile with various Grignard reagents to give the corresponding orthoaminoketones.

Abstract: Human topoisomerase I (top1) is the molecular target of a diverse set of anticancer compounds, including the camptothecins, indolocarbazoles, and indenoisoquinolines. These compounds bind to a transient top1-DNA covalent complex and inhibit the resealing of a single-strand nick that the enzyme creates to relieve superhelical tension in duplex DNA. (Hertzberg, R. P.; et al. Biochem. 1989, 28, 4629-4638. Hsiang, Y. H.; et al. J. Biol. Chem 1985, 260, 14873-14878. Champoux, J. J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001, 70, 369-413. Stewart, L.; et al. Science 1998, 729, 1534-1541.) We report the X-ray crystal structures of the human top1-DNA complex bound with camptothecin and representative members of the indenoisoquinoline and indolocarbazole classes of top1 poisons. The planar nature of all three structurally diverse classes allows them to intercalate between DNA base pairs at the site of single-strand cleavage. All three classes of compounds have a free electron pair near Arg364, a residue that if mutated confers resistance to all three classes of drugs. The common intercalative binding mode is augmented by unexpected chemotype-specific contacts with amino acid residues Asn352 and Glu356, which adopt alternative side-chain conformations to accommodate the bound compounds. These new X-ray structures explain how very different molecules can stabilize top1-DNA covalent complexes and will aid the rational design of completely novel structural classes of anticancer drugs.', 'Title: Camptothecin analogs with bulky, hydrophobic substituents at the 7-position via a Grignard reaction.

Abstract: Several norindenoisoquinolines substituted with methoxy or methylenedioxy groups have been prepared and their anticancer properties evaluated in cancer cell cultures and in topoisomerase I inhibition assays. 2,3-Dimethoxy-8,9-methylenedioxy-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline hydrochloride (14) is a strong topoisomerase I inhibitor and also displays very high cytotoxicity in the NCI cancer cell culture screen (mean graph midpoint of 50 nM).

Abstract: An ab initio quantum mechanics calculation is reported which predicts the orientation of indenoisoquinoline 4 in the ternary cleavage complex formed from DNA and topoisomerase I (top1). The results of this calculation are consistent with the hypothetical structures previously proposed for the indenoisoquinoline-DNA-top1 ternary complexes based on molecular modeling, the crystal structure of a recently reported ternary complex, and the biological results obtained with a pair of diaminoalkyl-substituted indenoisoquinoline enantiomers. The results of these studies indicate that the pi-pi stacking interactions between the indenoisoquinolines and the neighboring DNA base pairs play a major role in determining binding orientation. The calculation of the electrostatic potential surface maps of the indenoisoquinolines and the adjacent DNA base pairs shows electrostatic complementarity in the observed binding orientation, leading to the conclusion that electrostatic attraction between the intercalators and the base pairs in the cleavage complex plays a major stabilizing role.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a class of cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitors that offer certain advantages over the camptothecins, including the greater stabilities of the compounds themselves, as well as the greater stabilities of their drug-enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes. To investigate the possible biological roles of the di(methoxy) and methylenedioxy substituents present on the aromatic rings of the previously synthesized indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors, a series of compounds lacking these substituents was synthesized and tested for both cytotoxicity in cancer cell cultures and for enzyme inhibitory activity. The results indicate that the aromatic substituents make a small, but consistently observable contribution to the biological activity. Molecular models derived for the binding of the unsubstituted indenoisoquinolines in ternary complex with DNA and topoisomerase I indicate that the substituents on the lactam nitrogen project out of the major groove, and the carbonyl group is directed out of the minor groove, where it is involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain guanidine group of Arg364.

Molecular models derived for the binding of the unsubstituted indenoisoquinolines in ternary complex with DNA and topoisomerase I indicate that the substituents on the lactam nitrogen project out of the major groove, and the carbonyl group is directed out of the minor groove, where it is involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain guanidine group of Arg364. The DNA cleavage patterns observed in the presence of topoisomerase I and various indenoisoquinolines were similar, although significant differences were detected. There were also variations in the DNA cleavage pattern seen with camptothecin vs the indenoisoquinolines, which indicates that these two classes of topoisomerase I inhibitors are likely to target the cancer cell genome differently, resulting in different spectra of anticancer activity.

Abstract: 5H-8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxydibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one (ARC-111) has potent TOP1-targeting activity and pronounced antitumor activity. Several analogues of ARC-111 were synthesized with NH2, N-alkyl, N,N-dialkyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, and piperazinyl substituents at the 2-position of the 5-ethyl group. The relative TOP1-targeting activity and cytotoxicity of these structural analogues were assessed in RPMI8402 and P388 tumor cells and their camptothecin-resistant variants CPT-K5 and P388/CPT45, respectively. Potent TOP1-targeting activity was retained within a series of mono N-alkyl analogues that included NHCH2CH3, NHCH(CH3)2, and NHC(CH3)3. TOP1-targeting activity was diminished by the presence of a N-benzyl moiety. In a comparison of a series of N-alkyl-N-isopropyl analogues, activity decreased in the order CH3 > CH2CH3 > CH(CH3)2. Cytotoxicity in RPMI8402 and P388 did correlate with TOP1-targeting activity. Cytotoxic activity was also determined in KB3-1 cells and its variants KB/V-1 and KBH5.0. As KB/V-1 cells overexpress MDR1 and KBH5.0 cells overexpress BCRP, decreased cytotoxicity in these cell lines relative to the parent cell line is indicative of compounds that are substrates for these efflux transporters. In view of their diminished cytotoxicity in KB/V-1 cells, it appears that the likely demethylated metabolites of ARC-111, i.e., where NH2 or NHCH3 replaces the N(CH3)2 at the 2-position of the 5-ethyl substituent, are substrates for MDR1. In contrast, no significant difference in cytotoxicity among these three cell lines was observed with other N-alkyl analogues, including NHC2H5, NHCH(CH3)2, NHC(CH3)3, N(CH3)2, N(CH2CH3)2, NCH3(CH(CH3)2), and either the pyrrolidinyl or the piperidinyl analogues. The 2-(piperazinyl) analogues were associated with diminished cytotoxicity in KB/V-1 cells, suggesting that the second basic amino substituent is associated with their recognition as substrates by MDR1. Comparative studies on the antitumor activity of ARC-111 and its N-demethylated derivatives (the NHCH3 and NH2 analogues) against SJ-BT45 medulloblastoma xenografts in scid mice revealed that the secondary amine metabolite is at least as active as ARC-111 in vivo, although the primary amine derivative was significantly less potent.', 'Title: 5-(2-aminoethyl)dibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-ones: variation of n-alkyl substituents modulates sensitivity to efflux transporters associated with multidrug resistance.

Abstract: A new synthesis of isoaurones related to the alleged structure of isoaurostatin, via Heck intramolecular cyclization of cinnamic esters of 2-iodophenols, is reported. The cytotoxic activity of these isoaurones is lower than that of the structurally very similar 4-arylcoumarins.', 'Title: Total and semisynthesis and in vitro studies of both enantiomers of 20-fluorocamptothecin.  Abstract: Both enantiomers of 20-fluorocamptothecin and the racemate have been prepared by total synthesis. The (R)-enantiomer is essentially inactive in a topoisomerase-I/DNA assay, while the (S)-enantiomer is much less active than (20S)-camptothecin. The lactone ring of 20-fluorocamptothecin hydrolyzes more rapidly than that of camptothecin in PBS. The results provide insight into the role of the 20-hydroxy group in the binding of camptothecin to topoisomerase-I and DNA.', 'Title: Aza-analogues of the marine pyrroloquinoline alkaloids wakayin and tsitsikammamines: synthesis and topoisomerase inhibition.  Abstract: Two aza-analogues of the marine pyrroloquinoline alkaloids wakayin and tsitsikammamines A and B have been synthesized. The strategy used was based on a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between indole 4,7-dione and a diazo-aminopropane derivative. One of the two analogues partially inhibits human topoisomerase I, whereas synthetic intermediates inhibit the enzyme DNA cleavage activity at a concentration comparable to that of the control drug camptothecin.', 'Title: Synthesis and antitumor characterization of pyrazolic analogues of the marine pyrroloquinoline alkaloids: wakayin and tsitsikammamines.

The strategy used was based on [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions involving 3-ethylamine-indole-4,7-dione and different diazo reagents. All the compounds were evaluated in vitro for antiproliferative activity against five distinct cancer cell lines and for their inhibitory effect on topoisomerase isoenzymes I and II.

Dimethyl derivatives 1-6 were more active against carcinoma than leukemia cell lines. The tetrahydrobenzo derivatives 7-9 were scarcely active, whereas the corresponding benzo derivatives 10-12 showed notable cytotoxicity against a majority of the tested cell lines. Molecular modeling studies indicated that the high potency of 10 and 11, the most cytotoxic compounds of the whole series, could be due to the position of the condensed benzene ring, which favors pi-pi stacking interactions with purine and pyrimidine bases in the DNA active site.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines represent a class of non-camptothecin topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors that exert cytotoxicity by trapping the covalent complex formed between DNA and Top1 during relaxation of DNA supercoils. As an ongoing evaluation of Top1 inhibition and anticancer activity, indenoisoquinolines were linked via their lactam side chains to provide polyamines end-capped with intercalating motifs. The resulting bisindenoisoquinolines were evaluated for cytotoxicity in the National Cancer Institute's human cancer cell screen and for Top1 inhibition. Preliminary findings suggested that the 2-3-2 and 3-3-3 linkers, referring to the number of carbons between nitrogen atoms, were optimal for both potent Top1 inhibition and cytotoxicity. Using optimized linkers, bisindenoisoquinolines were synthesized with nitro and methoxy substituents on the aromatic rings. The biological results for substituted compounds revealed a disagreement between the structure-activity relationships of monomeric indenoisoquinolines and bisindenoisoquinolines as Top1 inhibitors, but cytotoxicity was maintained for both series of compounds.\", 'Title: Synthesis and cytotoxic activity of polyamine analogues of camptothecin.  Abstract: A number of derivatives of camptothecin with a polyamine chain linked to position 7 of camptothecin via an amino, imino, or oxyiminomethyl group were synthesized and tested for their biological activity. All compounds showed marked growth inhibitory activity against the H460 human lung carcinoma cell line. In particular, the iminomethyl derivatives where the amino groups of the chain were protected with Boc groups exhibited a high potency, with IC50 values of approximately 10(-8) M. The pattern of DNA cleavage in vitro and the persistence of the cleavable ternary complex drug-DNA-topoisomerase I observed with polyamine conjugates containing free amino groups support a contribution of specific drug interaction with DNA as a determinant of activity. Modeling of compound 7c in the complex with topoisomerase 1 and DNA is consistent with this hypothesis. The lack of a specific correlation between stabilization of the cleavable complex and growth inhibition likely reflects multiple factors including the cellular pharmacokinetic behavior related to the variable lipophilicity of the conjugate, and the nature and linkage of the polyamine moiety.', 'Title: Synthesis of 6-chloroisoquinoline-5,8-diones and pyrido[3,4-b]phenazine-5,12-diones and evaluation of their cytotoxicity and DNA topoisomerase II inhibitory activity.  Abstract: The substituted chloroisoquinolinediones and pyrido[3,4-b]phenazinediones were synthesized, and the cytotoxic activity and topoisomerase II inhibitory activity of the prepared compounds were evaluated. Chloroisoquinolinediones have been prepared by the reported method employing 6,7-dichloroisoquinoline-5,8-dione. The cyclization to pyrido[3,4-b]phenazinediones was achieved by adding the aqueous sodium azide solution to the dimethylformamide solution of corresponding chloroisoquinoline-5,8-dione. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated by a SRB (Sulforhodamine B) assay against various cancer cell lines such as A549 (human lung cancer cell line), SNU-638 (human stomach cancer cell), Col2 (human colon cancer cell line), HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma cell line), and HL-60 (human leukemia cell line). Almost all the synthesized pyrido[3,4-b]phenazinediones showed greater cytotoxic potential than ellipticine (IC(50)=1.82-5.97 microM). In general, the cytotoxicity of the pyrido[3,4-b]phenazinediones was higher than that of the corresponding chloroisoquinolinediones. The caco-2 cell permeability of selected compounds was 0.62 x 10(-6)-35.3 x 10(-6)cm/s.

Abstract: Indenoisoquinolines with lactam substituents such as ethylamino, propylamino, and butylamino have previously demonstrated potent biological activity, but an optimal length has never been established. In the present study, a series of simplified indenoisoquinoline analogues possessing a linker spacing of 0-12 carbon atoms between the lactam nitrogen and the terminal amino group have been prepared, determining that 2-4-atom lengths are optimal for topoisomerase I inhibition and cytotoxicity. Using these lengths, analogues were prepared with the amino group and portions of the linker replaced by a pyridine ring. A three-carbon spacer within the pyridine series still demonstrated potent topoisomerase I inhibition.', 'Title: Cells lacking DNA topoisomerase II beta are resistant to genistein.

Both flavonoids induced topo II-DNA complexes, but they did not induce significant levels of topo I-DNA complexes. Genistein decreased the topo II-DNA complexes induced by the topo II poison etoposide, suggestive of a catalytic inhibition of topo II, and luteolin decreased the topo I-DNA complexes induced by the topo I poison camptothecin, indicative of a catalytic inhibition of topo I. Murine transgenic cells lacking topo II beta were resistant to genistein-induced cell growth inhibition (XTT assays) and cytotoxicity (clonogenic assay). High levels of topo II beta-DNA complexes were also observed in K562 cells exposed to genistein. These data suggest that topo II beta has an important function in genistein-induced cell growth inhibition and cell death. The possible role of topoisomerases in the putative anticancer and carcinogenic properties of genistein and luteolin is discussed.', 'Title: Cells lacking DNA topoisomerase II beta are resistant to genistein.

Abstract: The efficacy of anthracycline based anticancer drugs is limited by pleiotropic drug resistance of tumor cells. Aiming at the design of anthracyclinone congeners capable of circumventing drug resistance, we synthesized naphthoindole containing derivatives of tryptophan and tryptamine. In doing so we adapted the traditional, gramine based approach for tryptophan and tryptamine synthesis. The most potent new compound, 3-(2-aminoethyl)-4,11-dihydroxynaphtho[2,3-f]indole-5,10-dione (16), was equally cytotoxic (IC(50) within low micromolar concentrations) for human K562 leukemia and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines and their isogenic sublines with genetically defined determinants of altered drug response, that is, the expression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein and loss of pro-apoptotic p53. Each of these mechanisms conferred resistance to the reference drug adriamycin. In contrast, naphthotryptamine 16, although less potent than adriamycin, was equally toxic for wild type cell lines and drug resistant counterparts. Moreover, at 3-5 microM 16 inhibited topoisomerase I in vitro. Thus, our novel naphthoindole based derivative of tryptamine gained new activities important for anticancer therapy, namely, suppression of topoisomerase I and the ability to overcome resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein expression and p53 dysfunction.', 'Title: Naphthoindole-based analogues of tryptophan and tryptamine: synthesis and cytotoxic properties.

The assay was also used to investigate the mode of binding adopted by several known DNA-binding agents, including SYBR Green and PicoGreen.

Abstract: Benzofuroquinolinediones (7c and 7d) were synthesized by base-catalyzed condensation of dichloroquinolinediones with phenolic derivatives. Their dialkylaminoalkoxy derivatives (8i-8p) were prepared by reaction with various dialkylaminoalkyl chlorides.

Abstract: In the context of the design and synthesis of minor groove binding and intercalating DNA ligands some new oligopyrrole carboxamides were synthesized. These hybrid molecules (combilexins) possess a variable and conformatively flexible spacer at the N-terminal end. As intercalating tricyclic systems acridone, acridine, anthraquinones and in a special case iminostilbene terminate the N-terminal end of the pyrrole chain.

Abstract: Amonafide (1), a naphthalimide which binds to DNA by intercalation and poisons topoisomerase IIalpha, has demonstrated activity in phase II breast cancer trials, but has failed thus far to enter clinical phase III because of dose-limiting bone marrow toxicity. Compound 17 (one of 41 new compounds synthesized) is a novel anticancer naphthalimide with a distinct mechanism of action, notably inducing autophagy and senescence in cancer cells.

Furthermore, 17 has shown itself to be superior to amonafide in vivo in models of (i) L1210 murine leukemia, (ii) MXT-HI murine mammary adenocarcinoma, and (iii) orthotopic models of human A549 NSCLC and BxPC3 pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Recent data suggest that curcumin, a phytochemical with cancer chemopreventive potential, might be useful in the treatment of several solid and hematological malignancies. DNA topoisomerases (topos) are the target of several drugs commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. These drugs induce topo-DNA complexes with either topo I or topo II; then cellular processing converts these complexes into permanent DNA strand breaks that trigger cell death. Using the TARDIS in vivo assay, this study shows for the first time that curcumin induces topo I and topo II (alpha and beta)-DNA complexes in K562 leukemia cells. A comparative analysis revealed that the levels of these complexes were higher than those induced by several standard topo I and topo II inhibitors at equitoxic doses. Curcumin-induced topo I and topo II-DNA complexes were prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine; this suggests that, unlike the standard topo inhibitors, reactive oxygen species may mediate the formation of these complexes. Overall, this work shows that curcumin is capable of inducing topo-DNA complexes in cells with both topo I and topo II and increases the evidence suggesting that this dietary agent has potential to be tested in cancer chemotherapy.', 'Title: Curcumin induces high levels of topoisomerase I- and II-DNA complexes in K562 leukemia cells.

Curcumin-induced topo I and topo II-DNA complexes were prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine; this suggests that, unlike the standard topo inhibitors, reactive oxygen species may mediate the formation of these complexes. Overall, this work shows that curcumin is capable of inducing topo-DNA complexes in cells with both topo I and topo II and increases the evidence suggesting that this dietary agent has potential to be tested in cancer chemotherapy.', 'Title: Synthesis and cytotoxic activity of a new series of topoisomerase I inhibitors.  Abstract: A series of structurally simple analogues of natural topopyrone C were synthesized and tested for cytotoxic and topoisomerase I inhibitory activities. The removal of the hydroxyl groups at the 5 and 9 positions resulted in an increased cytotoxic potency and ability to stabilize topoisomerase-mediated cleavage. In addition, the results suggest that some structural features, such as the pyrone ring and a polar group in position 11, are fundamental for topoisomerase I inhibitory effect. These structural requirements are also consistent with the cytotoxic activity.', 'Title: Synthesis and cytotoxic activity of a new series of topoisomerase I inhibitors.

Abstract: Novel derivatives of the marine alkaloid bengacarboline have been synthesized. The seco derivatives 11 and 12 were evaluated for topoisomerase inhibition, DNA damages, cytotoxicity and cell cycle perturbation. The two synthetic analogs are more potent cytotoxic agents than bengacarboline and they both induce an accumulation of cells in the S phase of DNA synthesis. They do not function as topoisomerase inhibitors but trigger DNA damages in cells.', 'Title: 1-deoxyrubralactone, a novel specific inhibitor of families X and Y of eukaryotic DNA polymerases from a fungal strain derived from sea algae.  Abstract: Talaroflavone (1) and 1-deoxyrubralactone (2) are natural compounds isolated from cultures of a fungal strain derived from sea algae, and their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. Compound 2 is a novel rubralactone derivative, 6-hydroxy-8-methoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3a,9b-tetrahydrocyclopenta[c]isochromene-3,5-dione. These compounds selectively inhibited the activities of families X and Y of eukaryotic DNA polymerases (pols), and compound 2 was a stronger inhibitor than compound 1. The IC(50) values of compound 2 on rat pol beta, which is a pol of family X, and human pol kappa, which is a pol of family Y, were 11.9 and 59.8 microM, respectively. On the other hand, compounds 1 and 2 did not influence the activities of the other families of eukaryotic pols, such as family A (i.e., pol gamma) and family B (i.e., pols alpha, delta, and epsilon), and showed no effect even on the activities of plant pols alpha and beta, prokaryotic pols, and other DNA metabolic enzymes, such as calf primase of pol alpha, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, human telomerase, T7 RNA polymerase, mouse IMP dehydrogenase (type II), human topoisomerase I and II, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and bovine deoxyribonuclease I. This is the first report about the selective inhibitors of families X and Y of eukaryotic pols.', \"Title: Isoindolo[2,1-a]quinoxaline derivatives, novel potent antitumor agents with dual inhibition of tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase I.  Abstract: Isoindoloquinoxalines 4 and 5 were obtained by refluxing 2-(2'-aminoaryl)-1-cyanoisoindoles 3a- e in acetic or formic acid. All derivatives were screened by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD) for the in vitro one dose primary anticancer assay against a 3-cell line panel. Compounds 4a- e, screened against a panel of about 60 human tumor cell lines, showed remarkable antineoplastic activity; they had GI 50 values in the low micromolar or submicromolar range and reached, in the case of 4c, nanomolar concentrations on 88% of the 59 tested cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle after treatment with 4c demonstrated an arrest of the cell cycle in G2/M phase. This effect was accompanied with apoptosis of the cells, mitochondrial depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Moreover, 4c induced a clear increase in the mitotic index, inhibited microtubule assembly in vitro, and interestingly also acted as a topoisomerase I inhibitor.\", \"Title: Isoindolo[2,1-a]quinoxaline derivatives, novel potent antitumor agents with dual inhibition of tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase I.

Abstract: Several new TOP1-targeting agents were prepared using as intermediates the N,N,N-trimethyl quaternary ammonium salts of either ARC-111 or its 12-aza analog (ARC-31), 3 and 4, respectively. Direct displacement of the quaternary ammonium group with water, imidazole, alkylethylenediamines, or polyhydroxylated alkylamines provides a convenient means for furthering the structure-activity relationships associated with these non-camptothecin TOP1-targeting agents.', 'Title: E-ring-modified 7-oxyiminomethyl camptothecins: Synthesis and preliminary in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation.  Abstract: In contrast to five-membered E-ring analogues, 7-oxyiminomethyl derivatives of homocamptothecins showed ability to form stable ternary complexes with DNA and topoisomerase I. The 7-oxyiminomethyl derivatives of homocamptothecins were evaluated as a racemic mixture. Following the isolation of the two enantiomers, the 20 (R)-hydroxy isomer confirms the best activity. By using a panel of human tumor cells, all tested homocamptothecins showed a potent antiproliferative activity, correlating to the persistence of the cleavable complex. No significant difference was observed between the natural scaffold and the corresponding homocamptothecin homologue. A selected compound of this series exhibited an excellent antitumor activity against human gastrointestinal tumor xenografts.', 'Title: Cytotoxic pyrroloiminoquinones from four new species of South African latrunculid sponges.  Abstract: An examination of organic extracts of four new species of South African latrunculid sponges, Tsitsikamma pedunculata, T. favus, Latrunculia bellae, and Strongylodesma algoaensis, yielded 13 known and eight new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids, 3-dihydro-7,8-dehydrodiscorhabdin C (4), 14-bromo-3-dihydro-7,8-dehydrodiscorhabdin C (5), discorhabdin V (6), 14-bromo-1-hydroxydiscorhabdin V (7), tsitsikammamine A N-18 oxime (10), tsitsikammamine B N-18 oxime (11), 1-methoxydiscorhabdin D (12), and 1-aminodiscorhabdin D (13).

Abstract: A series of unsymmetrically substituted polyamine derivatives were prepared and their cytotoxicities in mouse leukemia L1210, melanoma B16, and HeLa cells were investigated. The in vitro cytotoxicity revealed that these conjugates could recognize the polyamine transporter, and the N-ethyl modified homospermidine moiety may be another efficient carrier as homospermidine even though the introduction of terminal alkyl groups led to reduced cytotoxicity in comparison with the un-substituted counterpart 1. The ornithine decarboxylase and topoisomerase II inhibition experiments indicated that ODC and TOPO II were potential, but not unique targets of these conjugates. Furthermore, the in vivo antitumor activities illustrated that the representative conjugate 2f and the homospermidine analogue 1 evidently inhibited the tumor growth and significantly increased the survival time of mice-bearing sarcoma 180 cells.', 'Title: The contribution of plukenetione A to the anti-tumoral activity of Cuban propolis.  Abstract: Increasing efforts are directed toward finding applications for natural products and their derivatives in the treatment of human diseases. Among such products, propolis, a resinous substance produced by honey bees from various plant sources, has been found to be a promising source of potential therapeutics. In the present work, we aimed at studying the perspective of Cuban propolis as a source of possible anti-cancer agents. We found an anti-metastatic effect in mice and considerable cytotoxicity without cross-resistance in both wild-type and chemoresistant human tumor cell lines. Plukenetione A--identified for the first time in Cuban propolis--induced G0/G1 arrest and DNA fragmentation in colon carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the activities of both topoisomerase I and DNA polymerase were inhibited, while the expression of topoisomerase II-beta, EGF receptor, and multidrug resistance-related protein genes was found repressed. We assume that plukenetione A contributes to the anti-tumoral effect of Cuban propolis mainly by targeting topoisomerase I as well as DNA polymerase.', 'Title: The contribution of plukenetione A to the anti-tumoral activity of Cuban propolis.

Abstract: The synthesis, biological activity, and molecular modeling studies of C-ring-modified camptothecins are reported. A general synthetic protocol, based on \"C-5 camptothecin (C-5-CPT) enolate chemistry\", allows one to obtain various C5-substituted analogues. All new compounds, obtained as 1:1 epimeric mixtures, were tested for their antiproliferative activity. Experimental data showed that all novel derivatives are less active than the reference compounds and that one of the two epimers is more active than the other. Molecular docking simulations were performed to achieve more insight into the interactions between the new C5-modified CPTs and Topo I. A good correlation was observed when the data of cytotoxicity and the values calculated for the free binding energy were combined.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological activities of topoisomerase I inhibitors, 6-arylmethylamino analogues of edotecarin.

Among them, the three most potent pyridylmethyl analogues, compounds 22g, 22m, and 23c, showed better antitumor activities against MKN-45 human stomach cancer or MX-1 human breast cancer xenografted mice than those of edotecarin. Furthermore, compounds 22m and 23c exhibited complete response against MX-1 cells implanted in mice.', 'Title: Molecular design, synthesis and docking study of benz[b]oxepines and 12-oxobenzo[c]phenanthridinones as topoisomerase 1 inhibitors.

Radical cyclization of O-vinyl compounds preferentially led to the 7-endo-trig cyclization pathway to the benz[b]oxepines and 12-oxobenzo[c]phenanthridines through 6-exo-trig path as minor products. Among the synthesized compounds, benz[b]oxepine derivative 4e exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity against three different tumor cell lines, as well as topoisomerase 1 inhibitory activity.

Extracts identified by this process were further characterized by a selective yeast bioassay for inhibitors of topoisomerase I and by a biochemical assay for compounds that stabilize the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent binary complex. Five of the extracts were positive in the yeast bioassay, and eight extracts showed activity on the assay that monitors stabilization of the topoisomerase I-DNA complex. Four of the latter extracts were inactive in the yeast bioassay, and thus would not have been identified as hits without the COMPARE preselection process. One of the extracts, from Pyrenacantha klaineana, was selected for detailed investigation, and fractionation of this extract yielded camptothecin and 9-methoxycamptothecin as the bioactive constituents.\", 'Title: Cytotoxic sesquiterpenoids from Ratibida columnifera.  Abstract: Bioassay-directed fractionation of the flowers and leaves of Ratibida columnifera using a hormone-dependent human prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell line led to the isolation of 10 cytotoxic substances, composed of five novel xanthanolide derivatives (2-4, 7, and 8), a novel nerolidol derivative (9), and three known sesquiterpene lactones, 9alpha-hydroxy-seco-ratiferolide-5alpha-O-angelate+ ++ (1), 9alpha-hydroxy-seco-ratiferolide-5alpha-O-(2-methylbut yrate) (5), 9-oxo-seco-ratiferolide-5alpha-O-(2-methylbutyrate) (6), as well as a known flavonoid, hispidulin (10). On the basis of its cytotoxicity profile, compound 5 was selected for further biological evaluation, and was found to induce G1 arrest and slow S traverse time in parental wild type p53 A2780S cells, but only G2/M arrest in p53 mutant A2780R cells, with strong apoptosis shown for both cell lines. The activity of 5 was not mediated by the multidrug resistance (MDR) pump, and it was not active against several anticancer molecular targets (i.e., tubulin polymerization/depolymerization, topoisomerases, and DNA intercalation). While these results indicate that compound 5 acts as a cytotoxic agent via a novel mechanism, this substance was inactive in in vivo evaluations using the murine lung carcinoma (M109) and human colon carcinoma (HCT116) models.', 'Title: Isolation and biochemical characterization of a new topoisomerase I inhibitor from Ocotea leucoxylon.  Abstract: In a continuation of our search for potential tumor inhibitors from plants, we found that a crude extract from Ocotea leucoxylon showed selective activity typical of inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase I in a yeast assay for DNA-damaging agents. Using a bioassay-directed fractionation approach, the major bioactive compound was isolated and identified as the known aporphine alkaloid dicentrinone (4); the inactive alkaloid dicentrine (3) was also isolated. Compound 4 showed selective bioactivity against the rad52 repair-deficient yeast strain RS322 (IC(12) 49 microg/mL) and was inactive against the rad52- and topo1-deficient strain RS321 (IC(12) > 2000 microg/mL) and against the repair-proficient strain RJ03 (IC(12) > 2000 microg/mL). Biochemical studies with recombinant human topoisomerase I indicated that dicentrinone (4) is an inhibitor of the human enzyme. Colony formation studies suggest that it is weakly cytotoxic, but that its mechanism of toxicity differs from that of camptothecin and its derivatives.', 'Title: Isolation and biochemical characterization of a new topoisomerase I inhibitor from Ocotea leucoxylon.

Abstract: Lyngbyabellin A (1), a significantly cytotoxic compound with unusual structural features, was isolated from a Guamanian strain of the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. This novel peptolide is structurally related to dolabellin (2) in that both depsipeptides bear a dichlorinated beta-hydroxy acid and two functionalized thiazole carboxylic acid units. Its gross structure has been elucidated by spectral analysis, including 2D NMR techniques. The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was determined by chiral HPLC analysis of hydrolysis products and by characterization of the degradation products methyl 7,7-dichloro-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyloctanoate (3) and the corresponding acid 4. The total structure was further supported by molecular modeling studies. The isolation of 1 from L. majuscula once more supports the proposal that many compounds originally isolated from the sea hare Dolabella auricularia are of cyanobacterial origin.

Abstract: A reinvestigation of the fruiting bodies of the mushroom Leucopaxillus gentianeus, allowed the isolation of two minor cucurbitane triterpenes, namely, cucurbitacin D (5) and the new metabolite 16-deoxycucurbitacin B (6). The latter compound lacks an oxygenated substituent at C-16, an unprecedented structural feature among congeners of cucurbitacin B. The cucurbitanes present in the fruiting bodies were compared with those extracted from mycelia grown on the modified Melin-Norkans (MMN) culture medium. Cucurbitacins B (1) and D (5), as well as leucopaxillones A (3) and B (4), were isolated from both sources; in contrast, 16-deoxycucurbitacin B (6) and a mixture of fatty acid esters of cucurbitacin B (2) were absent in the mycelia. A new triterpene, 18-deoxyleucopaxillone A (7), was isolated from the mycelia, but was not detected in the fruiting bodies. The antiproliferative activity of the isolated triterpenes was determined against the NCI-H460 human tumor cell line, in comparison with the antitumor compound topotecan, a well-known topoisomerase I inhibitor.', \"Title: Novel azaphilones, kasanosins A and B, which are specific inhibitors of eukaryotic DNA polymerases beta and lambda from Talaromyces sp.  Abstract: Kasanosins A (1) and B (2) are novel azaphilones isolated from cultures of Talaromyces sp. derived from seaweed, and their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. These compounds selectively inhibited the activities of eukaryotic DNA polymerases beta and lambda (pols beta and lambda) in family X of pols, and compound 1 was a stronger inhibitor than compound 2. The IC(50) values of compound 1 on rat pol beta and human pol lambda were 27.3 and 35.0 microM, respectively. On the other hand, compounds 1 and 2 did not influence the activities of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is a pol of family X, and the other families of eukaryotic pols, such as family A (i.e., pol gamma), family B (i.e., pols alpha, delta, and epsilon) and family Y (i.e., pols eta, iota, and kappa), and showed no effect even on the activities of plant pol alpha, fish pol delta, prokaryotic pols, and other DNA metabolic enzymes, such as calf primase of pol alpha, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, human telomerase, T7 RNA polymerase, mouse inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (type II), human topoisomerases I and II, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and bovine deoxyribonuclease I. The results suggested that these novel compounds could identify the inhibition between pols beta, lambda, and TdT in family X.\", 'Title: Synthesis of N-substituted 5-[2-(N-alkylamino)ethyl]dibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridines as novel topoisomerase I-targeting antitumor agents.  Abstract: Several N-alkyl and N,N-dialkyl 5H-8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-aminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxydibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-ones have been identified as topoisomerase I-targeting agents with potent antitumor activity. In the present study, the impact on biological activity of substitution of a trifluoromethyl, cyano, aminocarbonyl, or ethynyl group on a N-methyl substituent of N,N-dimethyl-, N-methyl-N-ethyl-, and N-methyl-N-isopropyl 5H-8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-aminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxydibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-ones was assessed.', 'Title: Synthesis and cytotoxic properties of 4,11-bis[(aminoethyl)amino]anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-diones, novel analogues of antitumor anthracene-9,10-diones.  Abstract: We developed the synthesis of a series of thiophene-fused tetracyclic analogues of the antitumor drug ametantrone. The reactions included nucleophilic substitution of methoxy groups in 4,11-dimethoxyanthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-diones with ethylenediamines, producing the derivatives of 4,11-diaminoanthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione in good yields. Several compounds showed marked antiproliferative potency against doxorubicin-selected, P-glycoprotein-expressing tumor cells and p53(-/-) cells. The cytotoxicity of some novel compounds for P-glycoprotein-positive cells is highly dependent on N-substituent at the terminal amino group of ethylenediamine moiety. The cytotoxic potency of selected compounds correlated with their ability to attenuate the functions of topoisomerase I and telomerase, strongly suggesting that these enzymes are the major targets of antitumor activity of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione derivatives.', 'Title: Penicilliols A and B, novel inhibitors specific to mammalian Y-family DNA polymerases.  Abstract: Penicilliols A (1) and B (2) are novel 5-methoxy-3(2H)-furanones isolated from cultures of a fungus (Penicillium daleae K.M. Zalessky) derived from a sea moss, and their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. These compounds selectively inhibited activities of eukaryotic Y-family DNA polymerases (pols) (i.e., pols eta, iota and kappa), and compound 1 was a stronger inhibitor than compound 2. Among mammalian Y-family pols, mouse pol iota activity was most strongly inhibited by compounds 1 and 2, with IC(50) values of 19.8 and 32.5 microM, respectively. On the other hand, activities of many other pols, such as A-family (i.e., pol gamma), B-family (i.e., pols alpha, delta and epsilon) or X-family (i.e., pols beta, lambda and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase), and some DNA metabolic enzymes, such as calf primase of pol alpha, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase, human telomerase, T7 RNA polymerase, mouse IMP dehydrogenase (type II), human topoisomerases I and II, T4 polynucleotide kinase or bovine deoxyribonuclease I, are not influenced by these compounds. In conclusion, this is the first report on potent inhibitors of mammalian Y-family pols.', \"Title: Novel imidazo[1,2-a]naphthyridinic systems (part 1): synthesis, antiproliferative and DNA-intercalating activities.  Abstract: Novel imidazo[1,2-a]naphthyridinic systems 6a-15a and 6b-15b were obtained from Friedländer's reaction in imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine series. Most of the compounds were evaluated for their antitumor activity in the NCIs in vitro human tumor cell line screening panel. Among them, pentacyclic derivatives 13b and 14a exhibited in vitro activity comparable to anticancer agent such as amsacrine. Their mechanism of cytotoxicity action was unrelated to poisoning or inhibiting abilities against topo1. On the contrary, we highlighted a direct intercalation of the drugs into DNA by electrophoresis on agarose gel.\", 'Title: Design and synthesis of N-methylmaleimide indolocarbazole bearing modified 2-acetamino acid moieties as Topoisomerase I inhibitors.  Abstract: A novel series of N-methylmaleimide indolocarbazole derivatives bearing modified 2-acetamino acid moieties are first reported. The cytotoxic effects of these compounds were tested in five human tumor cell lines. The potent compounds 9a, 9b, 9d, and 9e have been further evaluated for their effect on Topoisomerase I (TOPO I) and cancer cell cycle. It is concluded that the indolocarbazoles with alkyl piperazine or morpholine substituent groups instead of esters or glycosyl residues would have better activities against tumors.', \"Title: Indole alkaloids and other constituents of Rauwolfia serpentina.  Abstract: From the dried roots of Rauwolfia serpentina were isolated five new indole alkaloids, N(b)-methylajmaline (1), N(b)-methylisoajmaline (2), 3-hydroxysarpagine (3), yohimbinic acid (4), isorauhimbinic acid (5), a new iridoid glucoside, 7-epiloganin (6), and a new sucrose derivative, 6'-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)glomeratose A (7), together with 20 known compounds. The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic and chemical means. The inhibitory activities of the selected alkaloids on topoisomerase I and II and their cytotoxicity against the human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell lines were assessed.\", \"Title: Antitumor agents 6.

All compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of representative liquid and solid human tumor cell lines and exhibit IC(50) values in the micromolar/submicromolar range. Series 2 displayed higher cytotoxicity than did series 3. The nature of the substituents on both imidazoline and triazinane N1 nitrogen markedly affected the activity profile of these series. Spectrophotometric and fluorescence measurements as well as unwinding assays performed on the most cytotoxic compounds, 2c, 2g, and 2k, showed that they are nonintercalative DNA agents and inhibit the catalytic activity of Topo II in a concentration-dependent mode. 2g was the most active Topo II inhibitor with activity levels comparable to those of VP-16.\", \"Title: Antitumor agents 6.

Abstract: The DNA binding efficacy and preferred mode of binding of a series of rhodamine-related chalcogenoxanthylium dyes was investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using ctDNA, [poly(dCdG)](2) and [poly(dAdT)](2), and by a topoisomerase I DNA unwinding (Topo I) assay. The dyes of this study showed tight binding to ctDNA with binding constants, K(b), on the order of 10(6)-10(7)M(-1). The ITC and Topo I assay studies suggested that the 9-substituent has a strong impact on binding modes ranging from an apparent preference for intercalation with a 9-2-thienyl substituent (similar binding to [poly(dCdG)](2) and [poly(dAdT)](2), re-supercoiling of DNA in the Topo I assay at <10(-5)M dye), to mixed binding modes with 9-phenyl derivatives (2- to 3-fold preference for binding to [poly(dAdT)](2), re-supercoiling of DNA in the Topo I assay at approximately 2 x 10(-5)M dye), to minor groove binding in a 9-(2-thienyl-5-diethylcarboxamide) derivative (strong preference for binding to [poly(dAdT)](2), did not show complete re-supercoiling in the Topo I assay). No binding to ctDNA was observed in one derivative with a 9-(3-thienyl-2-diethylcarboxamide) substituent, which cannot be co-planar with the xanthylium core. In series of dyes where the chalcogen atom was varied, the selenoxanthylium derivatives had 2- to 3-fold higher values of K(b) than the corresponding xanthylium, thioxanthylium, or telluroxanthylium derivatives, which all showed comparable values of K(b).

The analogs were prepared from 9-nitrocamptothecin via 7,9-diaminocamptothecin derivatives as a key intermediate.

Abstract: A novel series of topoisomerase I (Top I) inhibitors were designed on the basis of camptothecin using scaffold modification strategy. Thirty-one new compounds were synthesized and evaluated for anticell proliferation activity. The most potent compound 26 presented a significant inhibitory effect on Top I, leading to Top I-mediated cleavage and influences on Top I expression at the cellular level. Moreover, 26 was proved to induce cell death via apoptosis and accelerated DNA strand breaks without significant alteration in cell cycle populations. All of the experimental results herein indicated that 26 could interact with DNA-Top I complex and induce cancer cell apoptosis to produce antitumor effects.

The most potent compound 26 presented a significant inhibitory effect on Top I, leading to Top I-mediated cleavage and influences on Top I expression at the cellular level. Moreover, 26 was proved to induce cell death via apoptosis and accelerated DNA strand breaks without significant alteration in cell cycle populations. All of the experimental results herein indicated that 26 could interact with DNA-Top I complex and induce cancer cell apoptosis to produce antitumor effects. The in vivo evaluation of 26 on the growth of HT-29 tumor xenografts in nude mice suggested its therapeutic potential for further development.', 'Title: Discovery of a novel series of quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives as potential topoisomerase I inhibitors by scaffold modification.

Abstract: The cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of a series of substituted 9-aminoacridines is evaluated using topoisomerase I and cancer cell growth inhibition assays. In previous work, compounds of this type were shown to catalytically inhibit topoisomerase II, leading to a G1-S phase arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The present study expands the potential utility of these compounds in the development of cancer therapeutics by showing that these compounds inhibit proliferation of cell lines derived from the nine most common human cancers. Further results show that at least one of the compounds effectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA adduct formation in intact cells.

Abstract: Several new TOP1-targeting agents were prepared using as an intermediate the N,N,N-trimethyl quaternary ammonium salt 2 of ARC-111. Direct displacement of the quaternary ammonium group with hydroxide, cyclopropylamine, imidazole, 1H-1,2,3-triazole, alkylethylenediamines, ethanolamine, and polyhydroxylated alkylamines provides a convenient means for furthering insight into the structure-activity relationships within this series of non-camptothecin TOP1-targeting agents. The relative TOP1-targeting activities and cytotoxicities were evaluated in RPMI8402 and P388 cells and their camptothecin-resistant variants. Their potential to serve as substrates for the efflux transporters MDR1 and BCRP, which are associated with multidrug resistance, was also assessed.', 'Title: Photochemical electrocyclisation of 3-vinylindoles to pyrido[2,3-a]-, pyrido[4,3-a]- and thieno[2,3-a]-carbazoles: design, synthesis, DNA binding and antitumor cell cytotoxicity.

All thiazolobenzotriazole intermediates were tested in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the growth of two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In parallel, the newly synthesized skeletons were evaluated for DNA interaction, topoisomerases' inhibition, and cytotoxicity against HL60 and HL60/MX2 human leukemia cells.

Abstract: The aromathecin topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors offer promising scaffolds for the development of novel cancer chemotherapeutics. They are 'composites' of the camptothecin and indenoisoquinoline top1 inhibitors. Interestingly, some structure-activity relationship (SAR) overlap between the aromathecins and the indenoisoquinolines has been observed. For both classes, placement of certain polar groups in similar regions of the heteroaromatic system improves top1 inhibitory and antiproliferative activities. A series of water-soluble aromathecins substituted at position 14 with diaminoalkanes of various lengths has been prepared. These compounds all possess similar antiproliferative potency, but a general trend is observed: aromathecins with longer diaminoalkane substituents (>6 carbons) possess lower anti-top1 activity than their smaller counterparts (2-4 carbons), presumably as a result of unfavorable hydrophobic interactions. This trend is also noted with the indenoisoquinolines, revealing additional SAR overlap that supports the hypothesis that there is a 'universal' top1 inhibitor SAR.\", 'Title: 2-Thienyl-4-furyl-6-aryl pyridine derivatives: synthesis, topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, and structure-activity relationship study.

Abstract: We synthesized 12 benzoxanthone derivatives classified as three different groups based on the tetracyclic ring shapes and evaluated their pharmacological activities to find potential anticancer agents. In the cytotoxicity test, most compounds showed effective cancer cell growth inhibition against the HT29 and DU145 cell lines. Among the compounds tested, compound 19 was the most effective in the cancer cell lines tested. Compound 9 showed dual inhibitory activities against DNA relaxation by topoisomerases I and II. The% inhibition of compound 9 on topoisomerase I was comparable to that of camptothecin. Compound 9 efficiently blocked topoisomerase II function by almost threefold than etoposide at 20 microM.

For the C(6) anilino-substituted derivatives, (11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-yl)phenylamine (6a) was inactive. Structural optimization of 6a by the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the anilino-moiety resulted in the enhancement of antiproliferative activity in which the activity decreased in an order of para-OH, 7a>meta-OH, 8a>ortho-OH, 9a.

Abstract: Chemical transformation studies were conducted on betulinic acid (1), a common plant-derived lupane-type triterpene. Eleven new rationally designed derivatives of 1 (2-5 and 7-13) were synthesized based on docking studies and tested for their topoisomerase I and IIalpha inhibitory activity. Semisynthetic reactions targeted C-3, C-20, and C-28 in 1. Structures of the new compounds were confirmed by spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D NMR and MS). Compound 9, 3-O-[N-(phenylsulfonyl)carbamoyl-17beta-N-(phenylsulfonyl)amide]betulinic acid, showed 1.5-fold the activity of CPT in a topoisomerase I DNA relaxation assay. Four out of 14 betulinic acid analogues (5, 9, 11, and 12) showed 1.5-fold the activity of etoposide in a topoisomerase II assay. The new analogues exhibited better cytotoxic activities against the human colon cancer cells SW948 and HCT-116 and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 compared to the parent (1). Betulinic acid (1) is a potential scaffold for the design of new topoisomerase I and IIalpha inhibitors.', \"Title: 4-Pregnen-21-ol-3,20-dione-21-(4-bromobenzenesulfonate) (NSC 88915) and related novel steroid derivatives as tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) inhibitors.  Abstract: Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3'-phosphotyrosyl bonds. Such linkages form in vivo when topoisomerase I (Top1) processes DNA. For this reason, Tdp1 has been implicated in the repair of irreversible Top1-DNA covalent complexes. Tdp1 inhibitors have been regarded as potential therapeutics in combination with Top1 inhibitors, such as the camptothecin derivatives, topotecan, and irinotecan, which are used to treat human cancers. Using a novel high-throughput screening assay, we have identified the C21-substituted progesterone derivative, NSC 88915 (1), as a potential Tdp1 inhibitor. Secondary screening and cross-reactivity studies with related DNA processing enzymes confirmed that compound 1 possesses specific Tdp1 inhibitory activity. Deconstruction of compound 1 into discrete functional groups reveals that both components are required for inhibition of Tdp1 activity. Moreover, the synthesis of analogues of compound 1 has provided insight into the structural requirements for the inhibition of Tdp1. Surface plasmon resonance shows that compound 1 binds to Tdp1, whereas an inactive analogue fails to interact with the enzyme. On the basis of molecular docking and mechanistic studies, we propose that these compounds are competitive inhibitors, which mimics the oligonucleotide-peptide Tdp1 substrate. These steroid derivatives represent a novel chemotype and provide a new scaffold for developing small molecule inhibitors of Tdp1.\", 'Title: A series of alpha-heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones inhibit topoisomerase IIalpha catalytic activity.  Abstract: A series of novel thiosemicarbazone derivatives bearing condensed heterocyclic carboxaldehyde moieties were designed and synthesized. Among them, TSC24 exhibited broad antiproliferative activity in a panel of human tumor cells and suppressed tumor growth in mice. The mechanism research revealed that TSC24 was not only an iron chelator but also a topoisomerase IIalpha catalytic inhibitor. Its inhibition on topoisomerase IIalpha was due to direct interaction with the ATPase domain of topoisomerase IIalpha which led to the block of ATP hydrolysis. Molecular docking predicted that TSC24 might bind at the ATP binding site, which was confirmed by the competitive inhibition assay. These results about the mechanisms involved in the anticancer activities of thiosemicarbazones will aid in the rational design of novel topoisomerase II-targeted drugs and will provide insights into the discovery and development of novel cancer therapeutics based on the dual activity to chelate iron and to inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIalpha.', 'Title: A series of alpha-heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones inhibit topoisomerase IIalpha catalytic activity.

Abstract: Tryptanthrins have potential therapeutic activity against a wide variety of pathogenic organisms, although little is known about their mechanism. Activity against Escherichia coli, however, has not been examined. The effects of tryptanthrin (indolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-6,12-dione) and nine derivatives on growth, survival, and mutagenesis in E. coli were examined. Analogues with a nitrogen atom at the 4-position of tryptanthrin stopped log phase growth of E. coli cultures at concentrations as low as 5 microM. Tryptanthrins decreased viability during incubation with cells in buffer by factors of 10(-2) to <10(-6) at 0.2-40 microM. Derivatives with an oxime group at the 6-position exhibited the greatest bactericidal activity. Most tryptanthrins were not mutagenic in several independent assays, although the 4-aza and 4 aza-8-fluoro derivatives increased frameshift mutations about 22- and 4-fold, respectively.

Abstract: Anticancer drugs that bind to DNA and inhibit DNA-processing enzymes represent an important class of anticancer drugs. Combilexin molecules, which combine DNA minor groove binding and intercalating functionalities, have the potential for increased DNA binding affinity and increased selectivity due to their dual mode of DNA binding. This study describes the synthesis of DNA minor groove binder netropsin analogs containing either one or two N-methylpyrrole carboxamide groups linked to DNA-intercalating anthrapyrazoles. Those hybrid molecules which had both two N-methylpyrrole groups and terminal (dimethylamino)alkyl side chains displayed submicromolar cytotoxicity towards K562 human leukemia cells. The combilexins were also evaluated for DNA binding by measuring the increase in DNA melting temperature, for DNA topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated double strand cleavage of DNA, for inhibition of DNA topoisomerase IIalpha decatenation activity, and for inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I relaxation of DNA. Several of the compounds stabilized the DNA-topoisomerase IIalpha covalent complex indicating that they acted as topoisomerase IIalpha poisons. Some of the combilexins had higher affinity for DNA than their parent anthrapyrazoles. In conclusion, a novel group of compounds combining DNA intercalating anthrapyrazole groups and minor groove binding netropsin analogs have been designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated as possible novel anticancer agents.', 'Title: Synthesis and structure-activity relationship study of novel cytotoxic carbamate and N-acylheterocyclic bearing derivatives of betulin and betulinic acid.

Abstract: Aromathecins are inhibitors of human topoisomerase I (Top1). These compounds are composites of several heteroaromatic systems, namely the camptothecins and indenoisoquinolines, and they possess notable Top1 inhibition and cytotoxicity when substituted at position 14. The SAR of these compounds overlaps with indenoisoquinolines, suggesting that they may intercalate into the Top1-DNA complex similarly. Nonetheless, the proposed binding mode for aromathecins is purely hypothetical, as an X-ray structure is unavailable.

Abstract: Three series of indeno[1,2-c]isoquinolin-5,11-dione-amino acid conjugates were designed and synthesized. Amino acids were connected to the tetracycle through linkers with lengths of n=2 and 3 atoms using ester (series I), amide (series II), and secondary amine (series III) functions. DNA binding was evaluated by thermal denaturation and fluorescence measurements. Lysine and arginine substituted derivatives with n=3 provided the highest DNA binding. Arginine derivative 32 (n=2, series II) and glycine derivative 34 (n=2, series III) displayed high topoisomerase II inhibition. Incrementing the length of the N-6 side chain from two to three methylene units provided a significant increase in DNA affinity but a substantial loss in topoisomerase II inhibition. The most cytotoxic compounds toward HL60 leukemia cells were 19, 33, and 34 displaying micromolar IC(50) values.

Abstract: New N-alkylanilinoquinazoline derivatives 5, 12, 20, and 22 have been prepared from 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline 3, 4-chloro-6,7-methylenedioxyquinazoline 19, and commercially available anilines. Differents classes of compounds substituted by an aryloxygroup (6a-c, 16a,b, and 17a,b), (aminophenyl)ureas (12a,b and 13a-f), anilines (4a-m, 20a,b), N-alkyl(aniline) (5a-m, 21a,b, 22a,d), and N-aminoalkyl(aniline) (22e-g) have been synthesized. These molecules were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities and as potential DNA intercalating agents. We studied the strength and mode of binding to DNA of these molecules by DNA melting temperature measurements, fluorescence emission, and circular dichroism. The results of various spectral and gel electrophoresis techniques obtained with the different compounds, in particular compounds 5g and 22f, revealed significant DNA interaction. These experiments confirm that the N-aminoalkyl(anilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline nucleus is an efficient pharmacophore to trigger binding to DNA, via an intercalative binding process.', 'Title: Selection of evodiamine as a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor by structure-based virtual screening and hit optimization of evodiamine derivatives as antitumor agents.

Abstract: A panel of glycosylated DNA binding agents (1-12) designed as functional anthracycline mimics was screened against three solid-tumor cell lines (MCF-7, HT 29 and HepG2/C3A) and three non-tumor cell lines by the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) cell viability assay. Several compounds showed better in vitro cytotoxicity and selectivity against MCF-7 cells than daunomycin and doxorubicin, two known DNA binding agents that are clinically-used anti-cancer agents. Although the selectivity for HT 29 and HepG2/C3A cells is generally lower, the IC(50) values of some analogs against these two cancer cell lines were of the same magnitude as doxorubicin. Because there was no correlation between DNA binding affinity and cytotoxicity, and because topoisomerase (Topo) inhibition is another biological mechanism of action of most anthracycline drugs, Topo I/II inhibition assays with 1-12 were performed. Some of the compounds showed strong inhibition against these enzymes at 100μM, but there was no clear correlation between cytotoxicity and Topo I/II inhibition ability.

Abstract: Topoisomerase I (topo I) is an essential enzyme for vital cellular processes. Inhibition of topo I activities is lethal and leads to cell death, thus establishing topo I as a promising target for cancer treatment. Camptothecin, a natural alkaloid, inhibits topo I. Topotecan and irinotecan, synthetic derivatives of camptothecin, are the most potent anticancer drugs in clinical use. However, several limitations of camptothecins such as solubility, toxicity, stability, resistance and the required high drug dose have encouraged the development of non-camptothecin topo I inhibitors. Natural alkaloid benzo[c]phenanthridines and synthetic indenoisoquinolines have been extensively studied as alternatives to camptothecin. Interestingly, these non-camptothecin topo I inhibitors share a common 3-arylisoquinoline scaffold. This review will describe the development of novel indeno[1,2-c]isoquinolines, isoindolo[2,1-b]isoquinolines, 12-oxobenzo[c]phenanthridines and benz[b]oxepines with a 3-arylisoquinoline nucleus as topo I inhibitors.', 'Title: Synthesis and topoisomerase II inhibitory and cytotoxic activity of oxiranylmethoxy- and thiiranylmethoxy-chalcone derivatives.  Abstract: In order to find potential anticancer drug candidate targeting topoisomerases enzyme, we have designed and synthesized oxiranylmethoxy- and thiiranylmethoxy-retrochalcone derivatives and evaluated their pharmacological activity including topoisomerases inhibitory and cytotoxic activity. Of the compounds prepared compound 25 showed comparable or better cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines tested. Compound 25 inhibited MCF7 (IC(50): 0.49 ± 0.21 μM) and HCT15 (IC(50): 0.23 ± 0.02 μM) carcinoma cell growth more efficiently than references. In the topoisomerases inhibition test, all the compounds were inactive to topoisomerase I but moderate inhibitors to topoisomerase II enzyme. Especially, compound 25 inhibited topoisomerase II activity with comparable extent to etoposide at 100 μM concentrations. Correlation between cytotoxicity and topoisomerase II inhibitory activity implies that compound 25 can be a possible lead compound for anticancer drug impeding the topoisomerase II function.', 'Title: The first series of 4,11-bis[(2-aminoethyl)amino]anthra[2,3-b]furan-5,10-diones: Synthesis and anti-proliferative characteristics.

We identified several compounds that evoked a growth inhibitory effect at submicromolar concentrations. The anthra[2,3-b]furan-5,10-dione 9 with distal methylamino groups was markedly potent against drug-resistant cell lines with P-glycoprotein overexpression or p53 gene deletion. Furthermore, this derivative attenuated in vitro topoisomerase I-mediated DNA uncoiling at low micromolar concentrations.

These results demonstrate that anthrafurandiones are a new class of heterocyclic anthraquinone derivatives with the properties potentially valuable for anticancer therapy.', 'Title: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study of spin-labeled camptothecin derivatives: a different look of the ternary complex.  Abstract: Camptothecin (CPT) derivatives are clinically effective poisons of DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) able to form a ternary complex with the Top1-DNA complex.

Abstract: New tuftsin/retro-tuftsin conjugates were designed and synthesized using a classical fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase procedure. All the peptide conjugates were divided into three series: 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone (type A), 1-nitroacridine (type B), and 4-carboxyacridone (type C) derivatives. In type A conjugates, the N-terminal group of the peptide chain is directly connected to the anthraquinone ring at C1 (Scheme 1), whereas types B and C conjugates possess an amide bond formed between the carboxyl group of heterocyclic molecule and the N-termini of the tuftsin chain. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the tuftsin conjugates and their precursors using two human tumor cell lines (lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and myeloblastic leukemia (HL-60)) was investigated.

Abstract: Epoxide ring-opened xanthone derivatives were synthesized and tested for their topoisomerase inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity. Most of the compounds showed topo IIα specific inhibitory activity. To clarify the mechanism of action of these compounds, the most potent compound (compound 14) of the synthesized analogues was further studied by testing its ATPase inhibitory activity and through molecular docking experiments. The results showed that the topo IIα inhibitory activity of compound 14 was inversely proportional to ATP concentration. In the ATPase inhibitory test, ATP hydrolysis was reduced less efficiently by compound 14 (28.5±4.6%) than novobiocin (60.4±8.1%).

Abstract: We have reported the preparation and anticancer evaluation of certain 4-anilinofuro[2,3-b]quinolines. However, drawbacks such as lack of selective cytotoxicity, poor oral bioavailability, and poor water solubility exhibited by these compounds prompted us to search for newer derivatives. Among them, (E)-1-(4-(furo[2,3-b]quinolin-4-ylamino)phenyl)ethanone O-2-aminoethyloxime (13a) is selectively active against the growth of NCI-H460 and is highly water-soluble (63 μg/mL). Its hydrochloride salt, 13a·HCl exhibited not only excellent water solubility (1049 μg/mL) but also a high oral bioavailability (57.1%). Compound 13a may cause cancer cell apoptosis through inducing mitotic arrest and mitotic catastrophe mechanism. Xenographic studies indicated the tumor size with 13a·HCl treated nude mice was significantly lower than control. Further evaluation in an orthotopic lung cancer model indicated that 13a·HCl can be absorbed readily through oral administration, distributed to lung tissue, and exhibited significant efficacy in inhibiting the growth of lung cancers.', 'Title: Structure-activity relationships of carboline and carbazole derivatives as a novel class of ATP-competitive kinesin spindle protein inhibitors.  Abstract: The kinesin spindle protein (KSP) is a mitotic kinesin involved in the establishment of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle during cell division. It is considered to be an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy with reduced side effects. Based on natural product scaffold-derived fused indole-based inhibitors and known biphenyl-type KSP inhibitors, various carboline and carbazole derivatives were synthesized and biologically evaluated. β-Carboline and lactam-fused carbazole derivatives exhibited remarkably potent KSP inhibitory activity and mitotic arrest in prometaphase with formation of an irregular monopolar spindle. The planar tri- and tetracyclic analogs inhibited KSP ATPase in an ATP-competitive manner just like biphenyl-type inhibitors.', 'Title: Substituent effect on the preferred DNA binding mode and affinity of a homologous series of naphthalene diimides.  Abstract: A combination of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), topoisomerase I DNA unwinding assays, and ethidium bromide displacement studies were employed to investigate the binding of a homologous series of naphthalene diimides (NDI) to DNA. Our results suggest that the nature of the substituent plays a significant role in both the preferred binding mode and relative binding affinity of the compounds of this study. Only intercalative-type binding (K=15±3×10(6)M(-1)) was observed for the NDI with the smallest substituent (trimethyl-ethylamino), while larger members of the series (diethylmethyl-, dipropylmethyl- and dibutylmethyl-ethylamino substituents) adopted an additional binding mode of higher affinity (K(1)=31-78×10(6)M(-1)).', 'Title: Synthesis of 2,4-diaryl chromenopyridines and evaluation of their topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, and structure-activity relationship.

Abstract: The DNA-relaxing enzyme topoisomerase I (Top1) can be inhibited by heterocyclic compounds such as indolocarbazoles and indenoisoquinolines. Carbohydrate and hydroxyl-containing side chains are essential for the biological activity of indolocarbazoles. The current study investigated how similar functionalities could be \"translated\" to the indenoisoquinoline system and how stereochemistry and hydrogen bonding affect biological activity. Herein is described the preparation and assay of indenoisoquinolines substituted with short-chain alcohols, diols, and carbohydrates. Several compounds (including those derived from sugars) display potent Top1 poisoning and antiproliferative activities. The Top1 poisoning activity of diol-substituted indenoisoquinolines is dependent upon stereochemistry. Although the effect is striking, molecular modeling and docking studies do not indicate any reason for the difference in activity due to similar calculated interactions between the ligand and Top1-DNA complex and ambiguity about the binding mode. A stereochemical dependence was also observed for carbohydrate-derived indenoisoquinolines. Although similar trends were observed in other classes of Top1 inhibitors, the exact nature of this effect has yet to be elucidated.', 'Title: Synthesis, structure-activity relationship and biological evaluation of anticancer activity for novel N-substituted sophoridinic acid derivatives.  Abstract: Sophoridine (1), a natural anticancer drug, has been used in China for decades. A series of novel N-substituted sophoridinic acid derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity with 1 as the lead. The structure-activity relationship indicated that introduction of an aliphatic acyl on the nitrogen atom might significantly enhance the anticancer activity. Among the compounds, 6b bearing bromoacetyl side-chain afforded a potential effect against four human tumor cell lines (liver, colon, breast, and lung). The mechanism of action of 6b is to inhibit the activity of DNA topoisomerase I, followed by the S-phase arrest and then cause apoptotic cell death, similar to that of its parent 1. We consider 6b promising for further anticancer investigation.', 'Title: 7-azaindenoisoquinolines as topoisomerase I inhibitors and potential anticancer agents.  Abstract: A series of 7-azaindenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors have been prepared to investigate the effect of increased electron affinity of the aromatic system on the ability to stabilize the Top1-DNA cleavage complex.

The papillomavirus E2 protein can silence the long control region (LCR) promoter that controls viral E6 and E7 oncogene expression. The mechanisms by which E2 represses oncogene expression and the cellular factors through which E2 mediates this silencing are largely unknown. We conducted an unbiased, genome-wide siRNA screen and series of secondary screens that identified 96 cellular genes that contribute to the repression of the HPV18 LCR. In addition to confirming a role for the E2-binding bromodomain protein Brd4 in E2-mediated silencing, we identified a number of genes that have not previously been implicated in E2 repression, including the demethylase JARID1C/SMCX as well as EP400, a component of the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex. Each of these genes contributes independently and additively to E2-mediated silencing, indicating that E2 functions through several distinct cellular complexes to repress E6 and E7 expression.  This screen was conducted in the lab of Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School) at the ICCB-Longwood Screening Facility, Harvard Medical School.', 'Title: Ungeremine effectively targets mammalian as well as bacterial type I and type II topoisomerases.  Abstract: From the methanol extract of the bulbs of Pancratium illyricum L., three phenanthridine type alkaloids, ungeremine (1), (-)-lycorine (2) and (+)-vittatine (3) were isolated. For the evaluation of their anticancer and antibacterial potential, compounds 1-3 were tested against human (I, IIα) and bacterial (IA, IV) topoisomerases. Our data demonstrated that ungeremine impairs the activity of both, human and bacterial topoisomerases. Remarkably, ungeremine was found to largely increments the DNA cleavage promoted by bacterial topoisomerase IA, a new target in antimicrobial chemotherapy.', 'Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of bisintercalating DNA-binding piperazine-linked bisanthrapyrazole compounds as anticancer agents.  Abstract: A series of bisintercalating DNA binding bisanthrapyrazole compounds containing piperazine linkers were designed by molecular modeling and docking techniques. Because the anthrapyrazoles are not quinones they are unable to be reductively activated like doxorubicin and other anthracyclines and thus they should not be cardiotoxic. The concentration dependent increase in DNA melting temperature was used to determine the strength of DNA binding and the bisintercalation potential of the compounds. Compounds with more than a three-carbon linker that could span four DNA base pairs achieved bisintercalation. All of the bisanthrapyrazoles inhibited human erythroleukemic K562 cell growth in the low to submicromolar concentration range. They also strongly inhibited the decatenation activity of topoisomerase IIα and the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I. However, as measured by their ability to induce double strand breaks in plasmid DNA, the bisanthrapyrazole compounds did not act as topoisomerase IIα poisons. In conclusion, a novel group of bisanthrapyrazole compounds were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as potential anticancer agents.', 'Title: Catalytic inhibition of eukaryotic topoisomerases I and II by flavonol glycosides extracted from Vicia faba and Lotus edulis.  Abstract: Topoisomerases are essential enzymes involved in all processes of DNA metabolism, and their inhibitors have been identified as potential anticancer agents. The present study examined the effect of nine polyphenolic compounds derived from parts of two unique varieties of the Leguminosae, Vicia faba and Lotus edulis, on the activity of eukaryotic topoisomerases. We identified polyphenolic compounds that act as catalytic inhibitors of wheat germ topoisomerase I (IC50: 120-350 μM), human topoisomerase I (IC50: 110-260 μM), and human topoisomerase II (IC50: 240-600 μM) activities. Some compounds inhibited all enzymatic activities to a similar extent, while others exhibited specificity toward individual enzymes. The strongest catalytic inhibitor of all the examined enzymes was a kaempherol glycoside with an acetyl group linked to a sugar moiety. In addition, this compound inhibited the growth of human cancer cell lines MCF7, HeLa, and HepG2. The inhibition of topoisomerase I and II activities observed by the specific compounds possibly implies a role as potential agents in the prevention and therapy of cancer.', 'Title: Catalytic inhibition of eukaryotic topoisomerases I and II by flavonol glycosides extracted from Vicia faba and Lotus edulis.

Abstract: A library of substituted chromeno[3,4-b]indoles was developed as Lamellarin isosters. Synthesis was achieved from indoles after a four-step pathway sequence involving C-3 iodination, a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, and a one pot deprotection/lactonisation step. Twenty final compounds were tested in order to determine their activity against topoisomerase I and kinases, the two major biological activities of Lamellarins. One newly synthesized derivative exhibited a strong topoisomerase activity comparable to reference compounds such as campthotecin and Lamellarin with only a weak kinase inhibition. Two other lead compounds were identified as new nanomolar DYRK1A inhibitors and several other drugs affected the kinases in the sub-micromolar range. These results will enable us to use the chromeno[3,4-b]indole as a pharmacophore to develop potent treatments for neurological or oncological disorders in which DYRK1A is fully involved.', 'Title: Synthesis of chromeno[3,4-b]indoles as Lamellarin D analogues: a novel DYRK1A inhibitor class.

Abstract: Twelve dihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines were designed and synthesized which contain hydroxyl groups at ortho, meta or para position of 2- and 6-phenyl, or 2- and 4-phenyl rings attached to the central pyridine. They were evaluated for topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, and cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines for the development of novel anticancer agents. Generally, dihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines exhibited stronger topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, and cytotoxicity compared to those of monohydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines. The concrete structure-activity relationship was observed that dihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines with hydroxyl group at meta or para position of 2-phenyl ring displayed significant topoisomerase II inhibitory activity as well as cytotoxicity. Positive correlation between topoisomerase II inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity was observed for compounds 10, 12, 13, 17-20 and 22.', \"High-content genome-wide RNAi screens identify regulators of parkin upstream of mitophagy  An increasing body of evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (1).  Recent studies of the PD-associated genes PINK12 and PARK2 (Parkin) (3) suggest that they may act in a quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria (4-7).  Following the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the kinase Pink1 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin coordinate a rapid proteasomal (8) and autophagic (mitophagy) (6) response that may attenuate cell death (9-11).  Given that enhanced mitophagy may ameliorate the deleterious consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction (12-14), we hypothesized that genes regulating Parkin translocation would be useful drug targets for increasing mitochondrial quality control.  However, the mechanism of Parkin recruitment following Pink1 accumulation on the outer mitochondrial membrane is too poorly understood to target, and may involve a host of coordinated events.  To identify genes important for the Pink1-dependent recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria, we conducted two diverse genome-wide siRNA screens with high-throughput automation.  Our screening approach took advantage of the well-characterized phenotype of Parkin accumulation on depolarized mitochondria in cells (6).  Cells stably expressing GFP-Parkin and a mitochondrial-targeted red fluorescent protein were transfected with siRNA duplexes in 384-well plates.  After a 48 hour siRNA knockdown, the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to each well to induce rapid mitochondrial depolarization.  Following bulk mitochondrial depolarization in all cells within each well, GFP-Parkin translocation to the damaged mitochondria was allowed to progress for 2.5 hours and then cells were fixed.  The degree of Parkin translocation to the mitochondria of each cell was assessed by high-content analysis.  Primary screening yielded gene candidates involved in an array of diverse cellular processes that were validated in confirmatory assays.        References: 1.) Schapira, A. H. & Tolosa, E.

Abstract: Substances with dual tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I-topoisomerase I inhibitory activity in one low molecular weight compound would constitute a unique class of anticancer agents that could potentially have significant advantages over drugs that work against the individual enzymes. The present study demonstrates the successful synthesis and evaluation of the first dual Top1-Tdp1 inhibitors, which are based on the indenoisoquinoline chemotype. One bis(indenoisoquinoline) had significant activity against human Tdp1 (IC(50) = 1.52 ± 0.05 μM), and it was also equipotent to camptothecin as a Top1 inhibitor. Significant insights into enzyme-drug interactions were gained via structure-activity relationship studies of the series. The present results also document the failure of the previously reported sulfonyl ester pharmacophore to confer Tdp1 inhibition in this indenoisoquinoline class of inhibitors even though it was demonstrated to work well for the steroid NSC 88915 (7).

Abstract: A series of new N,N-dimethylaminopropyl- and 2-imidazolinyl-substituted derivatives of benzo[b]thienyl- and thieno[2,3-b]thienylcarboxanilides and benzo[b]thieno[2,3-c]- and thieno[3',2':4,5]thieno[2,3-c]quinolones were prepared. Quinolones were prepared by the reaction of photochemical dehydrohalogenation of corresponding anilides. Carboxanilides and quinolones were tested for the antiproliferative activity. 2-Imidazolinyl-substituted derivatives showed very prominent activity. By use of the experimentally obtained antitumor measurements, 3D-derived QSAR analysis was performed for the set of compounds. Highly predictive 3D-derived QSAR models were obtained, and molecular properties that have the highest impact on antitumor activity were identified. Carboxanilides 6a-c and quinolones 9a-c and 11a were evaluated for DNA binding propensities and topoisomerases I and II inhibition as part of their mechanism of action assessment. The evaluated differences in the mode of action nicely correlate with the results of the 3D-QSAR analysis. Taken together, the results indicate which modifications of the compounds from the series should further improve their anticancer properties.\", \"Title: Novel substituted benzothiophene and thienothiophene carboxanilides and quinolones: synthesis, photochemical synthesis, DNA-binding properties, antitumor evaluation and 3D-derived QSAR analysis.

Novel E-ring-modified camptothecin-4β-anilino-4'-O-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin conjugates as DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors and cytotoxic agents.  Abstract: Two conjugates (1 and 2) of camptothecin (CPT) and 4β-anilino-4'-O-demethylepipodophyllotoxin were previously shown to exert antitumor activity through inhibition of topoisomerase I (topo I). In this current study, two novel conjugates (1E and 2E) with an open E-ring in the CPT moiety were first synthesized and evaluated for biological activity in comparison with their intact E-ring congeners. This novel class of CPT-derivatives exhibits its antitumor effect against CPT-sensitive and -resistant cells, in part, by inhibiting topo I-linked DNA (TLD) religation. An intact E-ring was not essential for the inhibition of TLD religation, although conjugates with an open E-ring were less potent than the closed ring analogs. This lower religation potency resulted in decreased formation of protein-linked DNA breaks (PLDBs), and hence, less cell growth inhibition. In addition to their impact on topo I, conjugates 1E, 2, and 2E exhibited a minor inhibitory effect on topo II-induced DNA cleavage. The novel structures of 1E and 2E may present scaffolds for further development of dual function topo I and II inhibitors with improved pharmacological profiles and physicochemical properties.\", \"Title: Antitumor agents 294.

Abstract: A series of 3,6-bis(3-alkylguanidino) acridines was prepared and the interaction of these novel compounds with calf thymus DNA was investigated with UV-vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, in addition to DNA melting techniques. The binding constants K were estimated to range from 1.25 to 5.26 × 10(5) M(-1), and the percentage of hypochromism was found to be 17-42% (from spectral titration). UV-vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements indicated that the compounds act as effective DNA-intercalating agents. Electrophoretic separation proved that ligands 6a-e relaxed topoisomerase I at a concentration of 60 μM, although only those with longer alkyl chains were able to penetrate cell membranes and suppress cell proliferation effectively. The biological activity of novel compounds was assessed using different techniques (cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential) and demonstrated mostly transient cytostatic action of the ethyl 6c and pentyl 6d derivatives. The hexyl derivative 6e proved to be the most cytotoxic. Different patterns of cell penetration were also observed for individual derivatives.

Abstract: Hydroxylated analogues of the anticancer topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors indotecan (LMP400) and indimitecan (LMP776) have been prepared because (1) a variety of potent Top1 poisons are known that contain strategically placed hydroxyl groups, which provides a clear rationale for incorporating them in the present case, and (2) the hydroxylated compounds could conceivably serve as synthetic standards for the identification of metabolites. Indeed, incubating LMP400 and LMP776 with human liver microsomes resulted in two major metabolites of each drug, which had HPLC retention times and mass fragmentation patterns identical to those of the synthetic standards. The hydroxylated indotecan and indimitecan metabolites and analogues were tested as Top1 poisons and for antiproliferative activity in a variety of human cancer cell cultures and in general were found to be very potent. Differences in activity resulting from the placement of the hydroxyl group are explained by molecular modeling analyses.', 'Title: Lanostanoids from fungi: a group of potential anticancer compounds.  Abstract: Lanostanes are a group of tetracyclic triterpenoids derived from lanosterol. They have relevant biological and pharmacological properties, such as their cytotoxic effects via induction of apoptosis. This review compiles the most relevant lanostanoids studied from 2000 to 2011, principally those isolated from Ganoderma lucidum and other related fungi, such as Poria cocos, Laetiporus sulphureus, Inonotus obliquus, Antrodia camphorata, Daedalea dickinsii, and Elfvingia applanata, which have great potential as anticancer agents because of their cytotoxic or apoptotic effects. The compounds were selected on the basis of their proapoptotic mechanisms, through their ability to modify transcriptional activities via nuclear factors or genes and the activation or inhibition of pro- or antiapoptotic proteins; studies based only on their cytotoxicity were excluded from this review in the absence of complementary studies on their mechanisms of action. A total of 81 compounds from Ganoderma lucidum and other species from this genus are included, as well as 96 compounds isolated from other fungi, principally Poria cocos. Some of these compounds were found to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase, increase levels of p53 and Bax, or inhibit the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Other lanostanes have inhibitory effects on the growth of androgen prostate carcinoma through increasing the expression of p21, which activates the tumor suppressor protein p53, while other compounds have been shown to selectively inhibit topo II activity without affecting topo I. General considerations concerning the chemical structure-biological activities of these compounds are also discussed.', 'Title: Lanostanoids from fungi: a group of potential anticancer compounds.  Abstract: Lanostanes are a group of tetracyclic triterpenoids derived from lanosterol. They have relevant biological and pharmacological properties, such as their cytotoxic effects via induction of apoptosis. This review compiles the most relevant lanostanoids studied from 2000 to 2011, principally those isolated from Ganoderma lucidum and other related fungi, such as Poria cocos, Laetiporus sulphureus, Inonotus obliquus, Antrodia camphorata, Daedalea dickinsii, and Elfvingia applanata, which have great potential as anticancer agents because of their cytotoxic or apoptotic effects. The compounds were selected on the basis of their proapoptotic mechanisms, through their ability to modify transcriptional activities via nuclear factors or genes and the activation or inhibition of pro- or antiapoptotic proteins; studies based only on their cytotoxicity were excluded from this review in the absence of complementary studies on their mechanisms of action.

Abstract: Tumor hypoxia has been recognized as a common feature of solid tumors and a negative prognostic factor for response to treatment and survival of cancer patients. The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a molecular determinant of responses to hypoxia in mammalian cells, has renewed enthusiasm for discovery and development of targeted therapies exploiting the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. HIF-1 activity in tumors depends on availability of the HIF-1α subunit, the levels of which increase under hypoxic conditions and through activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Increased HIF-1 has been correlated with increased angiogenesis, aggressive tumor growth, and poor patient prognosis, leading to current interest in HIF-1 as promising anticancer drug target. In spite of an ever increasing number of putative small molecule inhibitors of HIF-1, only a few are progressing through preclinical and early clinical development. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in discovery and development of small molecule inhibitors that target the HIF-1 pathway as potential anticancer agents.', 'Title: Recent advances in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 inhibitors.

DNA replication stress is prevalent in cancer, but BIR has not been characterized in mammals. In a cyclin E overexpression model of DNA replication stress, POLD3, the human ortholog of POL32, was required for cell cycle progression and processive DNA synthesis. Segmental genomic duplications induced by cyclin E overexpression were also dependent on POLD3, as were BIR-mediated recombination events captured with a specialized DSB repair assay. We propose that BIR repairs damaged replication forks in mammals, accounting for the high frequency of genomic duplications in human cancers.  This RNAi screen aimed to identify genes whose functional inhibition would sensitize U-2 OS cells overexpressing cyclin-E (CCNE1) to oncogene induced DNA replication stress.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of indenoisoquinolines that inhibit both tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) and topoisomerase I (Top1).  Abstract: Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) plays a key role in the repair of damaged DNA resulting from the topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitor camptothecin and a variety of other DNA-damaging anticancer agents. This report documents the design, synthesis, and evaluation of new indenoisoquinolines that are dual inhibitors of both Tdp1 and Top1. Enzyme inhibitory data and cytotoxicity data from human cancer cell cultures were used to establish structure-activity relationships. The potencies of the indenoisoquinolines against Tdp1 ranged from 5 μM to 111 μM, which places the more active compounds among the most potent known inhibitors of this target. The cytotoxicity mean graph midpoints ranged from 0.02 to 2.34 μM. Dual Tdp1-Top1 inhibitors are of interest because the Top1 and Tdp1 inhibitory activities could theoretically work synergistically to create more effective anticancer agents.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of indenoisoquinolines that inhibit both tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (Tdp1) and topoisomerase I (Top1).

Abstract: The synthesis of new acridinone and dioxophenothiazine derivatives along with their tubulin polymerization inhibitory and antiproliferative activities is reported. The analysis of correlation for cytotoxic and antitubulin potential of tested compounds showed that 4-methoxyphenylethyl derivatives 18a and 19a were highly cytotoxic but were regarded to have no significant antitubulin activity. However, the introduction of a 3-hydroxy substituent leading to compounds 18e and 19e, strongly increased the antitubulin potential but was associated with a loss of the antiproliferative activity. Modeling studies, topoisomerase inhibition assays and cell cycle analysis have been performed to better investigate the mechanism of action of such compounds.', 'Title: Synthesis, antiproliferative activity and tubulin targeting effect of acridinone and dioxophenothiazine derivatives.

Abstract: The plant alkaloid lycobetaine has potent topoisomerase-targeting properties and shows anticancer activity. Based on these findings, several lycobetaine analogs were synthesized mainly differing in their substituents at 2, 8 and 9 position and their biological activities were evaluated. The topoisomerase-targeting properties and cytotoxicity of these structural analogs were assessed in the human gastric carcinoma cell line GXF251L. Performing a plasmid relaxation assay, an increased inhibition of topoisomerase I was found with N-methylphenanthridinium chlorides bearing a 8,9-methylenedioxy moiety or a methoxy group in 2-position. Furthermore, quaternized phenanthridinium derivatives bearing either a 2-methoxy or a 8,9-methylenedioxy moiety in conjunction with a 2-hydroxy or 2-methoxy group display potent topoisomerase II inhibition as shown by decatenation of kinetoplast DNA.

Abstract: A series of bis(hydroxymethyl)indolizino[6,7-b]indoles and their bis(alkylcarbamates) were synthesized for antitumor studies. These agents were designed as hybrid molecules of β-carboline (topoisomerase inhibition moiety) and bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrole (DNA cross-linking moiety). The preliminary antitumor studies indicated that these agents exhibited significant cytotoxicity against a variety of human tumor cells in vitro. Treatment of human breast carcinoma MX-1 xenograft-bearing nude mice with compounds 18b and 28c achieved more than 99% tumor remission. We also observed that 18a displayed potent therapeutic efficacy against human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and colon cancer HT-29 xenografts. These results revealed that compound 18a was more potent than irinotecan against HT-29 cells and was as potent as irinotecan against A549 cells in xenograft models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these derivatives possess multiple modes of action, such as induction of DNA cross-linking, inhibition of topoisomerase I and II, and cell-cycle arrest at the S-phase.', 'Title: Novel antitumor indolizino[6,7-b]indoles with multiple modes of action: DNA cross-linking and topoisomerase I and II inhibition.

Abstract: During a survey of actinobacteria known to suppress the growth of Streptomyces scabies (the causative agent of potato scab disease) in vivo, six new rhamnosylated alkaloids, the solphenazines A-F (1-6), were isolated from a biological control strain of Streptomyces (DL-93). The known rhamnosyl analogue of paraben (9) was also isolated along with a new rhamnosylated derivative of N-methyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (10). None of the compounds exhibited any antibacterial or antifungal activity against a standard panel of microorganisms, but compounds 1, 2, and 6 displayed some cytotoxicity against HCT-116 cancer cells. Additional in vitro testing provided data suggesting that the cytotoxic activity is not due to DNA intercalation or topoisomerase inhibition.', 'Title: Polycyclic hybrid isoprenoids from a reed rhizosphere soil derived Streptomyces sp.

Abstract: Two new hybrid isoprenoids, named indotertine B (2) and drimentine H (3), along with the known analogue drimentine C (4), were isolated from the reed rhizosphere soil derived actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CHQ-64. The structures of these compounds, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by extensive NMR, MS, and CD analyses. Indotertine B (2) exists as a pair of rotamers about the N-C(O) bond with a 2:1 ratio and displays activities against HCT-8 and A549 tumor cell lines with IC50 values of 6.96 and 4.88 μM, respectively.', 'Title: Indenoindolone derivatives as topoisomerase II-inhibiting anticancer agents.  Abstract: Based on known heterocyclic topoisomerase II inhibitors and anticancer agents, various indenoindolone derivatives were predicted as potential topoisomerase II-inhibiting anticancer agents. They are hydrazones, (thio)semicarbazones, and oximes of indenoindolones, and indenoindolols. These derivatives with suitable substitutions exhibited potent specific inhibition of human DNA TopoIIα while not showing inhibition of topoisomerase I and DNA intercalation, despite the fact that parent indenoindolones are known poor/moderate inhibitors of topoisomerase II. The potent topoisomerase II inhibitor indenoindolone derivatives exhibited good anticancer activities compared to etoposide and 5-fluorouracil, and relatively low toxicity to normal cells. These derivatizations of indenoindolones were found to result in enhancement of anticancer activities.', 'Camptothecin, a specific topoisomerase I inhibitor is a potent anticancer drug, especially against solid tumors. This agent produces well-characterized double-strand breaks upon collision of replication forks with topoisomerase I cleavage complexes. In an attempt to improve its efficacy, we conducted a synthetic lethal siRNA screening using a library that targets nearly 7000 human genes. Depletion of ATR, the main transducer of replication stress-induced DNA damage response exacerbated cytotoxic response to both camptothecin and the indenoisoquinoline LMP-400, a novel class of topoisomerase inhibitors in clinical trial.

Abstract: Camptothecin (CPT), a natural topoisomerase (Topo) I inhibitor, exhibits powerful antineoplastic activity against colorectal, breast, lung and ovarian cancers. However, the poor solubility and the inherent instability of the lactone E-ring in physiological pH resulted in low therapeutic efficacy and severe toxicity. In the past several decades' substantial progress toward understanding its pharmacology, lots of analogs have been prepared to overcome its drawbacks. The review provides a detailed discussion of the evolution in medicinal chemistry of CPT analogs with modification of the E-ring lactone.\", 'Title: Synthesis, cytotoxicity and topoisomerase II inhibitory activity of lomefloxacin derivatives.  Abstract: A novel series of amide derivatives of lomefloxacin were synthesized and evaluated for their topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity as well as cytotoxicity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines.

Abstract: Novel amidino-derivatives of phenylene-bisbenzothiazoles were synthesized and tested for their antiproliferative activity against several human cancer cell lines, as well as DNA-binding properties. The synthetic approach used for preparation of isomeric amidino substituted-phenylene-bis-benzothyazoles 3a-3f was achieved by condensation reaction of isophthaloyl dichloride 1a and terephthaloyl dichloride 1b or with phthalic acid 1c with 5-amidinium-2-aminobenzothiolate 2a and 5-(imidazolinium-2-yl)-2-aminobenzothiolate 2b in good yields. The targeted compounds were converted in the desired water soluble dihydrochloride salts by reaction of appropriate free base with concd HCl in ethanol or acetic acid. All tested compounds (3a-3f) showed antiproliferative effects on tumour cells in a concentration-dependant manner. The strongest activity and cytotoxicity was observed for diimidazolinyl substituted phenylene-bisbenzothiazole compound 3b. These effects were shown to be related to DNA-binding properties, topoisomerase I and II poisoning effects and apoptosis induction.

Abstract: In order to diversify the pharmacological activity of chalcones and extend the scaffold of topoisomerase and cathepsins B and L inhibitors, we have designed and synthesized total 18 chalcone compounds and tested their biological activity. In the topoisomerase inhibition test, most analogues in group III and IV except compound 11 exhibited more efficient topoisomerase I inhibitory activity than camptothecin at 20 μM. Compounds 15, 16 and 18 in group IV showed significant cathepsin B and L inhibitory activity. Among the compounds, compound 15 was most active with IC50 values of 1.81±0.05 μM on cathepsin B and 3.15±0.07 μM on cathepsin L, respectively.

Abstract: Numerous therapeutic applications have been proposed for molecules that bind heparin-binding proteins. Development of such compounds has primarily focused on optimizing the degree and orientation of anionic groups on a scaffold, but utility of these polyanions has been diminished by their typically large size and non-specific interactions with many proteins. In this study N-arylacyl O-sulfonated aminoglycosides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to selectively inhibit structurally similar bacterial and human topoisomerases. It is demonstrated that the structure of the aminoglycoside and of the N-arylacyl moiety imparts selective inhibition of different topoisomerases and alters mechanism. The results here outline a strategy that will be applicable to identifying small, structurally defined oligosaccharides that bind heparin-binding proteins with a high degree of selectivity.', 'Title: Dual-acting histone deacetylase-topoisomerase I inhibitors.  Abstract: Current chemotherapy regimens are comprised mostly of single-target drugs which are often plagued by toxic side effects and resistance development. A pharmacological strategy for circumventing these drawbacks could involve designing multivalent ligands that can modulate multiple targets while avoiding the toxicity of a single-targeted agent. Two attractive targets, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and topoisomerase I (Topo I), are cellular modulators that can broadly arrest cancer proliferation through a range of downstream effects. Both are clinically validated targets with multiple inhibitors in therapeutic use. We describe herein the design and synthesis of dual-acting histone deacetylase-topoisomerase I inhibitors. We also show that these dual-acting agents retain activity against HDAC and Topo I, and potently arrest cancer proliferation.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel tamoxifen analogues.  Abstract: A collection of compounds, structurally related to the anticancer drug tamoxifen, used in breast cancer therapy, were designed and synthesized as potential anticancer agents. McMurry coupling reaction was used as the key synthetic step in the preparation of these analogues and the structural assignment of E, Z isomers was determined on the basis of 2D-NOESY experiments. The compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity on breast cancer (MCF-7), cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and biphasic mesothelioma (MSTO-211H) human tumor cell lines. The estrogen like properties of the novel compounds were compared with those of the untreated controls using an estrogen responsive element-based (ERE) luciferase reporter assay and compared to 17β-estradiol (E2). Finally, with the aim to correlate the antiproliferative activity with an intracellular target(s), the effect on relaxation activity of DNA topoisomerases I and II was assayed.', 'Title: Novel synthetic acridine derivatives as potent DNA-binding and apoptosis-inducing antitumor agents.  Abstract: Acridine derivatives have been explored as DNA-binding anticancer agents. Some derivatives show undesired pharmacokinetic properties and new derivatives need to be explored. In this work, a series of novel acridine analogues were synthesized by modifying previously unexplored linkers between the acridine and benzene groups and their antiproliferative activity and the DNA-binding ability were evaluated. Among these derivatives, compound 5c demonstrated DNA-binding capability and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. In K562 cell lines, 5c induced apoptosis through mitochondria-dependent intrinsic pathways. These data suggested that compound 5c and other acridine derivatives with modified linkers between the acridine and benzene groups might be potent DNA-binding agents.', 'Title: Synthesis of imine-pyrazolopyrimidinones and their mechanistic interventions on anticancer activity.  Abstract: Design, synthesis and anticancer activity of a series of imine-pyrazolopyrimidinones is reported for the first time. Compounds 9d, 9n and 9o in the series show encouraging in vitro anticancer activity with low micromolar IC50 values against prostate (PC3) and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines.

Abstract: A series of 4β-[4'-(1-(aryl)ureido)benzamide]podophyllotoxin congeners (11a-l) were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against six human cancer cell lines. Some of the compounds like 11a, 11h, 11k and 11l showed significant anti-proliferative activity in Colo-205 cells and were superior to etoposide. The flow-cytometric analysis studies indicated that these compounds show strong G1 cell cycle arrest, as well exhibited improved inhibitory activities on DNA topoisomerase I and IIα enzymes. These compounds induce apoptosis by up regulating caspase-3 protein as observed by ELISA and Western blotting analysis. In addition, a brief structure-activity relationship studies within the series along with docking results of representative compounds 11a, 11h, 11k, 11l were presented.\", 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel mansonone E derivatives prepared via CuAAC click chemistry as topoisomerase II inhibitors.  Abstract: Two series of novel C-9 chloro- and bromo-substituted mansonone E derivatives with triazole moieties at the C-3 position were prepared by using copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. These compounds were found as potent inhibitors of topoisomerase II (Topo II) and topoisomerase I (Topo I). The Topo II-mediated pBR322 DNA relaxation and cleavage assay showed that the derivatives might act as catalytic inhibitors. Their cytotoxic activities against A549, HL-60, K562 and HeLa cells were evaluated, indicating that these compounds were potent antitumour agents. Their structure activity relationships and molecular docking study revealed that the substituents of the triazole were particularly important for cytotoxicity.', 'Title: Phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]quinazolin-5(4H)-one: a suitable scaffold for the development of noncamptothecin topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors.  Abstract: In search for a novel chemotype to develop topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors, the pyrazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline nucleus, structurally related to the indenoisoquinoline system precursor of well-known Top1 poisons, was variously decorated (i.e., a substituted phenyl ring at 2- or 3-position, a protonable side chain at 4- or 5-position), affording a number of Top1 inhibitors with cleavage patterns common to CPT and MJ-III-65.

Abstract: A series of new 1,13-cycloprotoberberine derivatives defined through variations at the 9-position were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicities in human HepG2 (hepatoma), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) and HCT116 (colon cancer) cells. The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) revealed that the replacement of 9-methoxyl with an ester moiety might significantly enhance the antiproliferative activity in vitro. Notably, compound 7f demonstrated equipotent cytotoxicity activity against breast cancer MCF-7 (parent) and doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/ADrR) cells, indicating a mode of action different from that of DOX. Further mechanism study showed that 7f significantly inhibited activity of DNA topoisomerase I (Top I) and Top II. G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell growth reduction was observed thereafter. Thus, we consider cycloprotoberberine analogues to be a new family of promising antitumor agents with an advantage of inhibiting drug-resistant cancer cells.', 'Title: Discovery, synthesis and biological evaluation of cycloprotoberberine derivatives as potential antitumor agents.

Abstract: As a continuous study we prepared several alkylamine (n = 3-6) and evaluated for the pharmacological activity and mode of action. In the topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) inhibition test, compound 4 showed strongest inhibitory activity among the compounds at 10 μM. Inhibitory activities of the compounds are in the order of 4 (n = 4) > 1 (n = 3) >> 5 (n = 5) ≈ 6 (n = 6); 8 (n = 4) >> 7 (n = 3) ≈ 9 (n = 5) ≈ 10 (n = 6) where n is the number of carbon in the aliphatic side chain in ring C and compounds 7-10 have additional methoxy group in ring A compared to compounds 1, 4-6. Compound 4 showed efficient cytotoxicities against T47D (IC₅₀: 0.93 ± 0.04 μM) and HCT15 (IC50: 0.78 ± 0.01 μM) cells, which are higher than etoposide. Compound 4 was also an ATP-competitive human topo IIα catalytic inhibitor with partially blocking human topo IIα-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis and intercalating into DNA. Compound 4 induced much less DNA damage than etoposide in HCT15 human colorectal carcinoma cells. Overall, compound 4 can be a potential anticancer agent acting as topo IIα catalytic inhibitor with low DNA damage.', 'Title: A new strategy to improve the metabolic stability of lactone: discovery of (20S,21S)-21-fluorocamptothecins as novel, hydrolytically stable topoisomerase I inhibitors.  Abstract: Lactone is a common structural motif in biologically active natural products. However, the metabolic instability of lactone significantly reduces their in vivo potency. In the present investigation, a new strategy to improve the metabolic stability of lactone was provided by the design of α-fluoro ether as a novel bioisostere of lactone. The effectiveness of the α-fluoro ether/lactone replacement was validated by the discovery of (20S,21S)-21-fluorocamptothecins as hydrolytically stable topoisomerase I inhibitors. A highly potent camptothecin derivative, 8l, was successfully identified, which showed excellent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities and represents a promising lead for the discovery of novel antitumor agents. Interestingly, this study also provided a new structure-activity relationship for the C21-carbonyl group of camptothecin, which has been regarded as an essential pharmacophore. Our results revealed that the conserved C21-carbonyl group can be replaced by a fluorine substituent. α-Fluoro ether may have general application in improving the metabolic stability of lactone.', 'Title: A new strategy to improve the metabolic stability of lactone: discovery of (20S,21S)-21-fluorocamptothecins as novel, hydrolytically stable topoisomerase I inhibitors.

Abstract: New oxoazabenzo[de]anthracenes derivatives were synthesised and characterised. Their interactions with calf thymus DNA were studied by UV spectrophotometric analysis and a competitive ethidium bromide displacement assay. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay, against colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2 cells). Among all the oxoazabenzo[de]anthracenes derivatives reported herein only the piperidino derivative exhibited strong DNA binding properties and cytotoxic activity with IC₅₀ values in the range of 16 ± 1.5 μM (72-h treatment). In addition, the piperidino derivative did not directly inhibit topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II enzymes. The results confirm that the presence of the oxoazabenzo[de]anthracenes together with the piperidino functionality is crucial in exerting DNA binding and cytotoxic properties, hence demonstrating promise as a chemical scaffold for further development of new anticancer agents.', 'Title: Synthesis, cytotoxicity and DNA binding of oxoazabenzo[de]anthracenes derivatives in colon cancer Caco-2 cells.

Abstract: A series of arylnaphthalimides were designed and synthesized to overcome the dose-limiting cytotoxicity of N-acetylated metabolites arising from amonafide, the prototypical antitumour naphthalimide whose biomedical properties have been related to its ability to intercalate the DNA and poison the enzyme Topoisomerase II. Thus, these arylnaphthalimides were first evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against two tumour cell lines and for their antitopoisomerase II in vitro activities, together with their ability to intercalate the DNA in vitro and also through docking modelization. Then, the well-known DNA damage response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was employed to critically evaluate whether these novel compounds can damage the DNA in vivo. By performing all these assays we conclude that the 5-arylsubstituted naphthalimides not only keep but also improve amonafide's biological activities.\", \"Title: Synthesis and study of antiproliferative, antitopoisomerase II, DNA-intercalating and DNA-damaging activities of arylnaphthalimides.

Abstract: Semisynthetic reactions were conducted on oleanolic acid, a common plant-derived oleanane-type triterpene. Ten rationally designed derivatives of oleanolic acid were synthesized based on docking studies and tested for their topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activity. Semisynthetic reactions targeted C-3, C-12, C-13, and C-17. Nine of the synthesized compounds were identified as new compounds.

Abstract: A series of new anilides (2a-c, 4-7, 17a-c, 18) and quinolones (3a-b, 8a-b, 9a-b, 10-15, 19) with nitrogen-bearing substituents from benzo[b]thiophene and thieno[2,3-c]thiophene series are prepared. Benzo[b]thieno[2,3-c]- and thieno[3',2':4,5]thieno[2,3-c]quinolones (3a-b, 8a-b) are synthesized by the reaction of photochemical dehydrohalogenation from corresponding anilides. Anilides and quinolones were tested for the antiproliferative activity. Fused quinolones bearing protonated aminium group, quaternary ammonium group, N-methylated and protonated aminium group, amino and protonated amino group (8a, 9b, 10-12) showed very prominent anticancer activity, whereby the hydrochloride salt of N',N'-dimethylaminopropyl-substituted quinolone (14) was the most active one, having the IC50 concentration at submicromolar range in accordance with previous QSAR predictions. On the other hand, flexible anilides were among the less active. Chemometric analysis of investigated compounds was performed. 3D-derived QSAR analysis identified solubility, metabolitic stability and the possibility of the compound to be ionized at pH 4-8 as molecular properties that are positively correlated with anticancer activity of investigated compounds, while molecular flexibility, polarizability and sum of hydrophobic surface areas were found to be negatively correlated. Anilides 2a-b, 4-7 and quinolones 3a-b, 8a-b, 9b and 10-14 were evaluated for DNA binding propensities and topoisomerases I/II inhibition as part of their mechanism of action. Among the anilides, only compound 7 presented some DNA binding propensity whereas the quinolones 8b, 9b and 10-14 intercalate in the DNA base pairs, compounds 8b, 9b and 14 being the most efficient ones. The strongest DNA intercalators, compounds 8b, 9b and 14, were clearly distinguished from the other compounds according to their molecular descriptors by the PCA and PLS analysis.\", 'Title: Optimization of the lactam side chain of 7-azaindenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors and mechanism of action studies in cancer cells.  Abstract: Optimization of the lactam ω-aminoalkyl substituents in a series of 7-azaindenoisoquinolines resulted in new anticancer agents with improved Top1 inhibitory potencies and cancer cell cytotoxicities. The new compounds 14-17 and 19 exhibited mean graph midpoint cytotoxicity (GI50) values of 21-71 nM in the NCI panel of 60 human cancer cell cultures. Ternary 7-azaindenoisoquinoline-DNA-Top1 cleavage complexes that persist for up to 6 h were detected in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Ternary complexes containing 7-azaindenoisoquinolines were significantly more stable than those in which camptothecin was incorporated. DNA content distribution histograms showed S-phase block 3 h after drug removal. Drug-induced DNA damage in HCT116 cells was revealed by induction of the histone γ-H2AX marker.

Abstract: Carbohydrate moieties were strategically transported from the indolocarbazole topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitor class to the indenoisoquinoline system in search of structurally novel and potent Top1 inhibitors. The syntheses and biological evaluation of 20 new indenoisoquinolines glycosylated with linear and cyclic sugar moieties are reported. Aromatic ring substitution with 2,3-dimethoxy-8,9-methylenedioxy or 3-nitro groups exerted strong effects on antiproliferative and Top1 inhibitory activities. While the length of the carbohydrate side chain clearly correlated with antiproliferative activity, the relationship between stereochemistry and biological activity was less clearly defined. Twelve of the new indenoisoquinolines exhibit Top1 inhibitory activity equal to or better than that of camptothecin. An advanced synthetic intermediate from this study was also used to efficiently prepare indotecan (LMP400) and indimitecan (LMP776), two anticancer agents currently under investigation in a Phase I clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health.', 'Title: Suzuki coupling based synthesis and in vitro cytotoxic evaluation of 7-heteroaryl-substituted camptothecin analogs.

To identify genes controlling this process, a whole RNAi genome screen (approximately 22,000 genes at 3 siRNAs per gene) was conducted via monitoring the cytotoxicity of the mesothelin-directed immunotoxin, SS1P.  SS1P, a Pseudomonas exotoxin-based immunotoxin, was chosen because it is now in clinical trials and has produced some significant tumor regressions in patients.  High and low concentrations of SS1P were chosen to allow for the identification of both mitigators and sensitizers, respectively.  As expected, silencing known essential genes in the immunotoxin pathway such as mesothelin, furin, KDEL receptor 2 or the members of the diphthamide pathway protected cells.  Of potential greater interest was the observation that many RNAi targets increased immunotoxin sensitivity, indicating that these gene products normally contribute to inefficiencies in the killing pathway.  Of top sensitizers, many genes encode proteins that locate to either the ER or Golgi and in particular are annotated as part of the secretory system.  Our results highlight new potential targets for chemical intervention that could increase immunotoxin killing of cancer cells and enhance our understanding of toxin trafficking.', 'Pathogen infection siRNA screens for Bartonella henselae, Brucella abortus and Salmonella typhimurium performed within the InfectX consortium (http://www.infectx.ch).', 'Inhibition of human topoisomerase 1 activity assessed as DNA triplex formation and presence of supercoiled DNA by microplate assay', 'Inhibition of human DNA topoisomerase 1 assessed as inhibition of DNA cleavage', 'Title: Haloemodin as novel antibacterial agent inhibiting DNA gyrase and bacterial topoisomerase I.  Abstract: Drug-resistant bacterial infections and lack of available antibacterial agents in clinical practice are becoming serious risks to public health. We synthesized a new class of haloemodins by modifying a traditional Chinese medicine component, emodin. The novel haloemodin exerts strong inhibitory activity on bacterial topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase, and not on the topoisomerases of human origin. In principle, it shows remarkable antibacterial activities against laboratory and clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We further expanded its antibacterial spectrum into against Gram-negative bacteria with the assistance of polymyxin B nonapeptide, which helps haloemodin to penetrate through the bacterial outer membrane. Finally, the therapeutic effect of haloemodin in vivo was confirmed in curing S. aureus-induced keratitis on rabbit model. With distinctive structural difference from the antibiotics we used, the haloemodins are of value as promising antibacterial pharmacophore, especially for combat the infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens.', \"Title: Synthesis, antiproliferative activity and DNA binding properties of novel 5-aminobenzimidazo[1,2-a]quinoline-6-carbonitriles.

Abstract: Using sophoridine (1) as the lead compound, a series of new N-substituted sophoridinic acid derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity. SAR analysis indicated that introduction of a chlorobenzyl on the 12-nitrogen atom of sophoridinol might significantly enhance the antiproliferative activity. Of the newly synthesized compounds, sophoridinol analogue 9k exhibited a potent effect against six human tumor cell lines (liver, colon, breast, lung, glioma and nasopharyngeal). The mode of action of 9k was to inhibit the DNA topoisomerase I activity, followed by the G0/G1 phase arrest. It also showed a moderate oral bioavailability and good safety in vivo. Therefore, compound 9k has been selected as a novel-scaffold lead for further structural optimizations or as a chemical probe for exploring anticancer pathways of this kinds of compounds.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and systematic evaluation of cytotoxic 3-heteroarylisoquinolinamines as topoisomerases inhibitors.

Abstract: A series of 9-(alkylthiomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins and pyrano-fused camptothecin derivatives were synthesized via the reaction of topotecan hydrochloride with various thiols and alkyl vinyl ethers respectively. In the reactions, topotecan hydrochloride was utilized as ortho-quinonemethide (o-QM) precursor. The configuration of 19 was determined by (1)H NMR and NOESY spectra as syn-isomers, suggesting that the cycloaddition of topotecan with alkyl vinyl ethers could undergo a hetero Diels-Alder reaction. All the synthesized compounds were screened on cancer cell lines HepG2, KB, HCT-8 and SGC7901. Some compounds were selected to assess their inhibitory activity against Topo I via Topo I mediated DNA cleavage assays. The results showed that among those tested 9-(alkylthiomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins, the compounds with bulkier hydrophobic side chains at 9-position have better bioactivities. As well as all pyrano-fused camptothecins possess antiproliferative activity against the tested cancer cell lines.

In xenograft models, 9a demonstrated significant activity without overt adverse effects at 5 and 10 mg/kg, comparable to 3 at 100 mg/kg. Notably, 9a at 300 mg/kg (i.p.) showed no overt toxicity in contrast to 1 (LD50 56.2 mg/kg, i.p.) and 3 (LD50 177.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Intact 9a inhibited Topo I activity in a cell-free assay in a manner similar to that of 1, confirming that 9a is a new class of Topo I inhibitor. 20-Sulfonylamidine 1-derivative 9a merits development as an anticancer clinical trial candidate.', 'Title: Design, synthesis, mechanisms of action, and toxicity of novel 20(s)-sulfonylamidine derivatives of camptothecin as potent antitumor agents.

Abstract: A series of eighteen trihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines were designed and synthesized which contain hydroxyl groups at ortho, meta or para position of each phenyl rings attached to the central pyridine. They were evaluated for topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, and cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines for the development of novel anticancer agents. Most of the compounds exhibited strong and selective topoisomerase II inhibitory activity compared to the positive control, etoposide, and also displayed significant cytotoxicity in low micromolar range. Trihydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines were more potent than mono- and di-hydroxylated 2,4,6-triphenyl pyridines, which have been previously studied in our research group. Positive correlation between topoisomerase II inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity was observed for the most compounds. Molecular docking study shows qualitatively consistent with the results of biological assays.', 'Title: Novel multi-targeting anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-diones with guanidine-containing side chains: interaction with telomeric G-quadruplex, inhibition of telomerase and topoisomerase I and cytotoxic properties.  Abstract: Novel generations of antitumor anthraquinones are expected to be advantageous over the conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Previous structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated an importance of the positively charged side chains conjugated to anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione scaffolds. Exploring a role of individual side chain moieties in binding to the duplex and G-quadruplex DNA, modulation of telomerase and topoisomerase I activities, intracellular accumulation and cytostatic potency, we herein analyzed a series of reported and newly synthesized guanidine-containing derivatives of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione. We found that the number of cationic side chains (namely, two) is critical for a tight interaction with human telomeric G-quadruplex (TelQ). Along with a larger drug-TelQ association constant, the telomerase attenuation by anthrathiophenediones with two basic groups in the side chains was more pronounced than by the analogs bearing one basic group. For mono-guanidinated compounds the substituent with the amino group in the side chain provided better TelQ affinity than the methylamine residue. The intracellular uptake of the mono-guanidino derivative with two side chains was >2-fold higher than the respective value for the bis(guanidino) derivative. This difference can explain a lower antiproliferative potency of bis(guanidine) containing compounds. Thus, the modifications of side chains of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione differently modulated drug-target interactions and cellular effects. Nevertheless, the selected compound 11-(3-aminopropylamino)-4-(2-guanidinoethylamino)anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione 13 demonstrated a high affinity to TelQ and the ability to stabilize the quadruplex structure. These properties were paralleled by reasonable potency of 13 as a telomerase/topoisomerase I inhibitor and an antiproliferative agent. These results indicate that the structural elements of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione derivatives can be balanced to yield a candidate for further preclinical study.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of benzimidazole acridine derivatives as potential DNA-binding and apoptosis-inducing agents.  Abstract: The discovery of new effective DNA-targeted antitumor agent is needed because of their clinical significance. As acridines can intercalate into DNA and benzimidazoles have the ability to bind in the DNA minor groove, a series of novel benzimidazole acridine derivatives were designed and synthesized to be new DNA-targeted compounds. MTT assay indicated that most of the synthesized compounds displayed good antiproliferative activity, among which compound 8l demonstrated the highest activity against both K562 and HepG-2 cells. Further experiments showed that 8l displayed good DNA-binding capability and inhibited topoisomerase I activity. Moreover, compound 8l could induce apoptosis in K562 cell lines through mitochondrial pathway. These data suggested that compound 8l might be potential as new DNA-binding and apoptosis-inducing antitumor agents.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel homocamptothecin analogues as potent antitumor agents.  Abstract: Fifteen novel homocamptothecin derivatives with α-OMe substituted E-rings were designed and synthesized. All of the derivatives exhibited similar or superior cytotoxicities compared with that of SN-38, and they inhibited Topo I activity in a cell-free assay in a manner similar to that of SN-38, confirming that they represent a new class of Topo I inhibitors. Notably, the water soluble compound 36o (1.2 mg/mL) exhibited increased lactone stability, and at 0.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg, it demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mice bearing a xenograft model using human colon cancer cell line HT-29. On the basis of these positive results, further development of 36o-related compounds as potential anticancer clinical trial candidates is definitely warranted.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel homocamptothecin analogues as potent antitumor agents.

Abstract: The first synthesis of C5-curcumin-fatty acid (C5-Curc-FA) conjugates was successfully performed. Through a two-step synthetic route, 10 analogs were synthesized for a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. It was found that C5-Curc-FA conjugates containing either decanoic acid or palmitic acid moieties were cytotoxic against colorectal adenocarcinoma cell (CCL-229) at IC50s ranging from 22.5 to 56.1μg/mL, being 5c the most active C5-Curc-FA conjugate. Our results strongly suggests that a decanoic acid moiety at the meta position in C5-Curc-FA conjugates is important for their anticancer activity effect. Possible mechanisms for the anticancer activity of C5-Curc-FA conjugates were also investigated including apoptosis induction, mitochondrial damage and caspases activation. It was shown that 5c inhibited the luminescence activity of NFκB, a key signaling molecule involved in cell apoptosis and cell proliferation, at IC50=18.2μg/mL. In addition, it was demonstrated that 5c displayed significant apoptotic effect at GI50=46.0μg/mL in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC CCL-222), which can be explained by the significant mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspases 3 and 7 activation effect of 5c. Finally, it was investigated that C5-Curc-FA conjugates can affect the replication process of cancer cells, since compounds 5c, 5e, and 6c inhibited the relaxing activity of the human DNA topoisomerase I at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that range from 50 to 250μg/mL. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that the inhibition of both NFκB and DNA topoisomerase I by C5-Curc-FA conjugates is associated with their anticancer activity.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 7-alkylamino substituted benzo[a]phenazin derivatives as dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitors.  Abstract: A novel series of benzo[a]phenazin derivatives bearing alkylamino side chains were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their topoisomerases inhibitory activity as well as cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines (HL-60, K-562, HeLa, and A549). These compounds were found to be dual inhibitors of topoisomerase (Topo) I and Topo II, and exhibited excellent antiproliferative activity, in particular against HL-60 cells with submicromolar IC50 values. Further mechanistic studies showed that this class of compounds acted as Topo I poisons by stabilizing the Topo I-DNA cleavage complexes and Topo II catalytic inhibitors by inhibiting the ATPase activity of hTopo II. Molecular docking studies revealed the binding modes of these compounds for Topo I and Topo II.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 7-alkylamino substituted benzo[a]phenazin derivatives as dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitors.

Abstract: A series of novel pyridyl acridone derivatives comprised of a pseudo-five-cyclic system to extend the π-conjugated acridone chromophore, were designed and synthesized as potent DNA binding antitumor compounds. Most synthesized compounds displayed good activity against human leukemia K562 cells in MTT tests, with compound 6d exhibiting the highest activity with IC50 value at 0.46 μM. Moreover, 6d showed potent activities against solid tumor cell lines (0.16-3.79 μM). Several experimental studies demonstrated that the antitumor mode of action of compound 6d involves DNA intercalation, topoisomerase I inhibition, and apoptosis induction through the mitochondrial pathway. In summary, compound 6d represents a novel and promising lead structure for the development of new potent anticancer DNA-binding agents.', \"Title: Water-soluble isoindolo[2,1-a]quinoxalin-6-imines: in vitro antiproliferative activity and molecular mechanism(s) of action.  Abstract: Water-soluble isoindoloquinoxalin (IIQ) imines and the corresponding acetates were conveniently prepared from the key intermediates 2-(2'-aminophenyl)-2H-isoindole-1-carbonitriles obtained by a Strecker reaction between substituted 1,2-dicarbaldehydes and 1,2-phenylenediamines. Both series were screened by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD) and showed potent antiproliferative activity against a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines. Several of the novel compounds showed GI50 values at a nanomolar level on the majority of the tested cell lines. Among IIQ derivatives, methoxy substituents at positions 3 and 8 or/and 9 were especially effective in impairing cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. These effects were associated to IIQ-mediated impairment of tubulin polymerization at pharmacologically significant concentrations of tested compounds. In addition, impaired DNA topoisomerase I functions and perturbation in telomere architecture were observed in cells exposed to micromolar concentrations of IIQ derivatives.

Here we describe a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify genes regulating the human macrophage TNF-alpha response to LPS. We also conducted a secondary validation screen with six independent siRNAs per gene to facilitate removal of off-target screen hits, and we generated microarray data from the same LPS-treated macrophage cells to facilitate downstream data analysis.

Abstract: A study of structure-based modulation of known ligands of hTopoIIα, an important enzyme involved in DNA processes, coupled with synthesis and in vitro assays led to the establishment of a strategy of rational switch in mode of inhibition of the enzyme\\'s catalytic cycle. 6-Arylated derivatives of known imidazopyridine ligands were found to be selective inhibitors of hTopoIIα, while not showing TopoI inhibition and DNA binding. Interestingly, while the parent imidazopyridines acted as ATP-competitive inhibitors, arylated derivatives inhibited DNA cleavage similar to merbarone, indicating a switch in mode of inhibition from ATP-hydrolysis to the DNA-cleavage stage of catalytic cycle of the enzyme. The 6-aryl-imidazopyridines were relatively more cytotoxic than etoposide in cancer cells and less toxic to normal cells. Such unprecedented strategy will encourage research on \"choice-based change\" in target-specific mode of action for rapid drug discovery.', 'Title: Selective Inhibition of Bacterial Topoisomerase I by alkynyl-bisbenzimidazoles.

Abstract: A new series of thirty-six dihydroxylated 2,6-diphenyl-4-aryl pyridines containing hydroxyl groups at the ortho, meta, or para position of 2- and 6-phenyl rings attached to the central pyridine were designed and synthesized. They were evaluated for topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines for the development of novel anticancer agents. Most of the compounds with hydroxyl moiety either at the meta or para position of 2- or 6-phenyl ring in combination with thienyl or furyl group at 4-position of central pyridine displayed significant topoisomerase II inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity. Positive correlation between topoisomerase II inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity was observed for the compounds 9-11, 15-17, 19, 21-23, 28, and 41. Among all the synthesized compounds, compound 17 emerged as the most promising topoisomerase II inhibitor with significant cytotoxicity.', 'Title: Topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, and structure-activity relationship study of dihydroxylated 2,6-diphenyl-4-aryl pyridines.

Abstract: Six unusual xanthone-chromanone dimers, versixanthones A-F (1-6), featuring different formal linkages of tetrahydroxanthone and 2,2-disubstituted chroman-4-one monomers, were isolated from a culture of the mangrove-derived fungus Aspergillus versicolor HDN1009. The absolute configurations of 1-6, representing the central and axial chirality elements or preferred helicities, were established by a combination of X-ray diffraction analysis, chemical conversions, and TDDFT-ECD calculations. The interconversion of different biaryl linkages between 1 and 4 and between 2 and 3 in DMSO by a retro-oxa-Michael mechanism provided insight into the formation of the xanthone-chromanone dimers and supported the assignments of their absolute configurations. Compounds 1-6 exhibited cytotoxicities against the seven tested cancer cell lines, with the best IC50 value of 0.7 μM. Compound 5 showed further inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I.', 'Title: Synthesis of functionalized new conjugates of batracylin with tuftsin/retro-tuftsin derivatives and their biological evaluation.  Abstract: New batracylin conjugates with tuftsin/retro-tuftsin derivatives were designed and synthesized using T3P as a coupling agent. The conjugates possess an amide bond formed between the carboxyl group of heterocyclic molecule and the N-termini of the tuftsin/retro-tuftsin chain. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the new analogues and their precursors was evaluated using a series of human and murine tumor cells. BAT conjugates containing retro-tuftsin with branched side aminoacid chain, in particular with leucine or isoleucine, were about 10-fold more cytotoxic toward two human tumor cell lines (lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and myeloblastic leukemia (HL-60)). These compounds showed about 10-fold increased cytotoxicity against the two types of tumor cells compared to parent BAT. We have not observed important differences in the mechanism of action between BAT and its cytotoxic tuftsin/retro-tuftsin conjugates. We propose that high biological activity of the most active BAT conjugates is a result of their greatly increased intracellular accumulation.', 'Title: Synthesis and Characterization of 4,11-Diaminoanthra[2,3-b]furan-5,10-diones: Tumor Cell Apoptosis through tNOX-Modulated NAD(+)/NADH Ratio and SIRT1.

Compounds 11-14 utilized multiple mechanisms of cytotoxicity including inhibition of Top1/Top2-mediated DNA relaxation, reduced NAD(+)/NADH ratio through tNOX inhibition, suppression of a NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase activity, and activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Here, for the first time, we report that tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) and SIRT1 are important cellular targets of antitumor anthracene-9,10-diones.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-substituted indenoisoquinoline derivatives as topoisomerase I inhibitors.  Abstract: A new series of indenoisoquinoline derivatives was designed and synthesized. The in vitro anti-proliferative activity of these novel compounds was evaluated in HepG2, A549 and HCT-116 cell lines. Compounds 9a, 9b, 10a, 10c, 10e, 18a and 18b manifested potent inhibitory activity against the three tested cancer cell lines. Nineteen compounds were also tested for Top I inhibition at 50 μM. Almost all the tested compounds showed potent Top I inhibition activity at this concentration. The most potent compounds 9a and 10a demonstrated more cytotoxicity than HCPT and TPT and was comparable to CPT in inhibitory activities on Top I in our biological assay.', 'Title: 3-(Dipropylamino)-5-hydroxybenzofuro[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-one (DPA-HBFQ-1) plays an inhibitory role on breast cancer cell growth and progression.  Abstract: A series of unknown 3-(alkyl(dialkyl)amino)benzofuro[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-ones 4-17 has been synthesized as new ellipticine analogs, in which the carbazole moiety and the pyridine ring were replaced by a dibenzofuran residue and a pyrimidine ring, respectively. The synthesis of these benzofuroquinazolinones 4-17 was performed in a simple one-pot reaction using 3-aminodibenzofuran or its 2-methoxy derivative, as starting materials. From 3-(dipropylamino)-5-methoxybenzofuro[2,3-f] quinazolin-1(2H)-one (13), we prepared 3-(dipropylamino)-5-hydroxybenzofuro[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-one (18), referred to as DPA-HBFQ-1. The cytotoxic activities of all the synthesized compounds, tested in different human breast cancer cell lines, revealed that DPA-HBFQ-1 was the most active compound. In particular, the latter was able to inhibit anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth and to induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive and -negative breast cancer cells. It did not affect proliferation and apoptotic responses in MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells. The observed effects have been ascribed to an enhanced p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression in a p53-dependent manner of tumor suppressor and to a selective inhibition of human topoisomerase II. In addition, DPA-HBFQ-1 exerted growth inhibitory effects also in other cancer cell lines, even though with a lower cytotoxic activity. Our results indicate DPA-HBFQ-1 as a good candidate to be useful as cancer therapeutic agent, particularly for breast cancer.', 'Title: 3-(Dipropylamino)-5-hydroxybenzofuro[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-one (DPA-HBFQ-1) plays an inhibitory role on breast cancer cell growth and progression.

Abstract: Novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors have gained considerable interest for the development of anticancer agents. In this study, a series of 1,3-benzoazolyl-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential Topo II catalytic inhibitors. It was found that some of derivatives had good antiproliferative activity on seven cancer cell lines, especially on HL-60/MX2, a cancer cell line derivative from HL-60 that is resistant to Topo II poison. Topo II mediated DNA relaxation assay results showed that derivatives could significantly inhibit the activity of Topo II, and the structure-activity relationship studies indicated the importance of the alkylamino side chain and the benzoazolyl group. Further mechanism studies revealed that derivatives function as Topo II nonintercalative catalytic inhibitors and may block the ATP binding site of Topo II.

Abstract: We have synthesized certain indeno[1,2-b]quinoxaline derivatives for antiproliferative evaluation. Among them, 11-{[3-(dimethylamino)propoxy]imino}-N-[3-(dimethylamino) propyl]-11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxaline-6-carboxamide (10a) was active against the growth of MDA-MB231, PC-3, and Huh-7 with IC50 values of 0.87 (selectivity index, SI = 36.22), 0.82 (SI = 38.43), and 0.64 μM (SI = 49.23) respectively. Compound 10a was inactive against the growth of normal human fetal lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) with an IC50 value of 31.51 μM. Its analogs, 10b and 10c, were also active against the growth of MB231, PC-3, and Huh-7 with IC50 values of <1.0 μM in each case. Our results have also indicated compounds 10a-10c exhibited comparable inhibitory activities against topo I and topo II with the positive compound 2 at a concentration of 10 μM. Mechanism studies indicated that compound 10a induced cell cycle arrest at S phase via activation of caspase-3, -7 and an increase in the protein expression of Bad and Bax but a decrease in expression of Bcl-2 and PARP, which consequently cause cell death. In addition, compound 10a attenuated the levels of phosphorylated Src, Akt-1, and Akt-2 protein levels but did not affect the total protein expression of Akt. We have also implanted human hepatocellular carcinoma cells into the yolk sac of zebrafish larvae and incubated larvae with various concentrations of 10a.

Abstract: Fluorine and chlorine are metabolically stable, but generally less active replacements for a nitro group at the 3-position of indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase IB (Top1) poisons. A number of strategies were employed in the present investigation to enhance the Top1 inhibitory potencies and cancer cell growth inhibitory activities of halogenated indenoisoquinolines. In several cases, the new compounds' activities were found to rival or surpass those of similarly substituted 3-nitroindenoisoquinolines, and several unusually potent analogs were discovered through testing in human cancer cell cultures. A hydroxyethylaminopropyl side chain on the lactam nitrogen of two halogenated indenoisoquinoline Top1 inhibitors was found to also impart inhibitory activity against tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterases 1 and 2 (TDP1 and TDP2), which are enzymes that participate in the repair of DNA damage induced by Top1 poisons.\", \"Title: Discovery of antitumor anthra[2,3-b]furan-3-carboxamides: Optimization of synthesis and evaluation of antitumor properties.

At low micromolar concentrations the selected derivative of (R)-3-aminopyrrolidine 3c and its stereoisomer (S)-3-aminopyrrolidine 3d caused an apoptotic cell death preceded by an arrest in the G2/M phase. Studies of intracellular targets showed that 3c and 3d formed stable intercalative complexes with the duplex DNA as determined by spectral analysis and molecular docking. Both 3c and 3d attenuated topoisomerase 1 and 2 mediated unwinding of the supercoiled DNA via a mechanism different from conventional DNA-enzyme tertiary complex formation.

Abstract: Malignant tumor cells have been found to have high levels of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), supporting the hypothesis that a prodrug could be activated by intracellular H2O2 and lead to a potential antitumor therapy. In this study, the 7-ethyl-10-boronic acid camptothecin (B1) was synthesized for the first time as prodrug of SN-38, by linking a cleavable aryl carbon-boron bond to the SN-38. Prodrug B1 selectively activated by H2O2, converted rapidly to the active form SN-38 under favorable oxidative conditions in cancer cells with elevated levels of H2O2. The cell survival assay showed that prodrug B1 was equally or more effective in inhibiting the growth of six different cancer cells, as compared to SN-38. Unexpectedly, prodrug B1 displayed even more potent Topo I inhibitory activity than SN-38, suggesting that it was not only a prodrug of SN-38 but also a typical Topo I inhibitor. Prodrug B1 also demonstrated a significant antitumor activity at 2.0 mg/kg in a xenograft model using human brain star glioblastoma cell lines U87MG.', \"Title: Investigation of the Structure-Activity Relationships of Aza-A-Ring Indenoisoquinoline Topoisomerase I Poisons.

The resulting compounds were tested to establish the optimal nitrogen position for topoisomerase IB (Top1) enzyme poisoning activity and cytotoxicity to human cancer cells. The 4-aza compounds were the most likely to yield derivatives with high Top1 inhibitory activity. However, the relationship between structure and cytotoxicity was more complicated since the potency was influenced strongly by the side chains on the lactam nitrogen.

The resulting compounds were tested to establish the optimal nitrogen position for topoisomerase IB (Top1) enzyme poisoning activity and cytotoxicity to human cancer cells. The 4-aza compounds were the most likely to yield derivatives with high Top1 inhibitory activity. However, the relationship between structure and cytotoxicity was more complicated since the potency was influenced strongly by the side chains on the lactam nitrogen. The most cytotoxic azaindenoisoquinolines 45 and 46 had nitrogen in the 2- or 3-positions and a 3'-dimethylaminopropyl side chain, and they had MGM GI50 values that were slightly better than the corresponding indenoisoquinoline 64.\", 'Title: Synthesis and biological activity of pyrazole analogues of the staurosporine aglycon K252c.  Abstract: A derivative of the staurosporine aglycon (K252c), in which the lactam ring was replaced by a pyrazole moiety, was synthesized. The resulting indolopyrazolocarbazole (3) inhibited Pim isoforms 1-3 whereas it did not impair the activity of two known targets of K252c, protein kinase C isoforms α and γ. Compound 3 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity toward human leukemia and colon carcinoma cell lines (K562 and HCT116), strongly suggesting that this new scaffold deserves further investigations for treatment of malignancies associated with Pim activity.', 'Inhibition of human recombinant topoisomerase 1-mediated relaxation of supercoiled pBS (SK+) DNA at 60 uM after 30 mins by ethidium bromide staining based agarose gel electrophoresis', 'Poisoning activity at human recombinant topoisomerase 1 assessed as stabilization of enzyme-supercoiled pBS (SK+) DNA complex at 60 uM after 30 mins by ethidium bromide staining based agarose gel electrophoresis', 'Poisoning activity at topoisomerase 1 in human MCF7 cells at 10 uM after 12 hrs by immunoband depletion assay', 'Inhibition of CPT mediated formation of topoisomerase 1-supercoiled pBS (SK+) DNA complex in human MCF7 cells at 10 uM preincubated for 2 hrs followed by CPT addition measured after 4 to 12 hrs by immunoband depletion assay', 'Title: Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Potential Prodrugs Related to the Experimental Anticancer Agent Indotecan (LMP400).

Abstract: Scaffold-hopping of bioactive natural product aurones has been studied for the first time. 2-Arylideneimidazo[1,2-a]pyridinones as potential topoisomerase IIα (hTopoIIα)-targeting anticancer compounds were considered. A multifunctional activator, polyphosphoric acid, enabled to realize a cascade reaction of 2-aminopyridine with 2,3-epoxyesters toward synthesis of 2-arylideneimidazo[1,2-a]pyridinones. Most of the compounds exhibited hTopoIIα-selective poison activity with efficiency more than etoposide and DNA-binding property, while not interacting with hTopo I. The compounds showed pronounced antiproliferative activities in nanomolar range with relatively poor toxicity to normal cells, inhibition of invasiveness, and apoptotic effect. The activities for inhibition of tubulin assembly, CDK1 and pCDK1, were also observed. Interestingly, the hTopoIIα inhibitory (in vitro and ex vivo studies) and antiproliferative activities of representative potent compounds were found to be manifold higher compared to corresponding parent aurones bearing alike substitutions, indicating the importance of such scaffold-hopping strategy in medicinal chemistry research.', 'Title: Scaffold-hopping of bioactive flavonoids: Discovery of aryl-pyridopyrimidinones as potent anticancer agents that inhibit catalytic role of topoisomerase IIα.  Abstract: A strategy of scaffold-hopping of bioactive natural products, flavones and isoflavones, leading to target-based discovery of potent anticancer agents has been reported for the first time. Scaffold-hopped flavones, 2-aryl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones and the scaffold-hopped isoflavones, 3-aryl-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones were synthesized via Pd-catalyzed activation-arylation methods. Most of the compounds were found to exhibit pronounced human topoisomerase IIα (hTopoIIα) inhibitory activities and several compounds were found to be more potent than etoposide (a hTopoIIα-inhibiting anticancer drug). These classes of compounds were found to be hTopoIIα-selective catalytic inhibitors while not interfering with topoisomerase I and interacted with DNA plausibly in groove domain. Cytotoxicities against various cancer cells, low toxicity in normal cells, and apoptotic effects were observed. Interestingly, compared to parent flavones/isoflavones, their scaffold-hopped analogs bearing alike functionalities showed significant/enhanced hTopoIIα-inhibitory and cytotoxic properties, indicating the importance of a natural product-based scaffold-hopping strategy in the drug discovery.', \"Title: Novel securinine derivatives as topoisomerase I based antitumor agents.

In this study, a series of novel securinine derivatives bearing β'-hydroxy-α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety were designed and synthesized via a Baylis-Hillman reaction for screening as Topo I inhibitors and antitumor agents. Their topoisomerase I inhibitory activity as well as their cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines (A549, HeLa, HepG2, SH-SY5Y) were evaluated, and two pairs of diastereomers 4a-1 and 4a-6 with significant Topo I inhibitory activity and potent anti-proliferative activity against cancer cell lines were identified. The diastereomers were separated, and absolute configurations of five pairs of diastereomers were identified based on X-ray crystallographic analysis and circular dichroism (CD) spectra analysis.

Compounds 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and 19 with thienyl or furyl moiety at the 2-position and hydroxyl group at the meta or para positions of 4-phenyl ring displayed strong to moderate topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) inhibitory activity and significant antiproliferative activity. The evaluation of compound 16 to determine its mechanism of action was performed with topo IIα-DNA cleavable complex, topo IIα-mediated ATPase assay, DNA unwinding and in vitro and ex vivo topo IIα relaxation assay. Compound 16 functioned as a DNA non-intercalative topo IIα catalytic inhibitor with better potency than etoposide in T47D breast cancer cells. Molecular docking study revealed that compound 16 cannot intercalate into regularly stacked base-pairs of DNA duplex but can interact or intercalate to topo IIα-bound DNA.\", 'Title: Fluorescein hydrazones: A series of novel non-intercalative topoisomerase IIα catalytic inhibitors induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in breast and colon cancer cells.  Abstract: Fluorescein hydrazones (5 and 7) were synthesized in three/four steps with 82-92% yields. All synthesized compounds were evaluated by topoisomerase I (topo I) and topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα)-mediated relaxation and cell viability assays. Among them, most of the compounds showed topo I & IIα inhibitory activity and nineteen compounds showed strong anti-proliferative activity against various cell lines. In brief, 5e inhibited 53% topo IIα (etoposide 29%) at 20 μM and showed excellent antiproliferative activity against DU145 (1.43 ± 0.04 μM), HCT15 (2.4 ± 0.03 μM) and MCF7 (11.4 ± 0.5 μM) cell lines in comparison with adriamycin, etoposide, and camptothecin. Compounds 5e, 5g and 5h were further evaluated to determine their mode of action. Compounds 5e, 5g and 5h functioned as non-intercalative topo IIα catalytic inhibitor with induction of G1 arrest and activation of apoptotic proteins in dose-dependent manner.', 'Title: Fluorescein hydrazones: A series of novel non-intercalative topoisomerase IIα catalytic inhibitors induce G1 arrest and apoptosis in breast and colon cancer cells.

Abstract: Novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors have gained considerable interest for the development of anticancer agents. In this study, a series of carbazole derivatives containing chalcone analogs (CDCAs) were synthesized and investigated for their Topo II inhibition and cytotoxic activities. The results from Topo II mediated DNA relaxation assay showed that CDCAs could significantly inhibit the activity of Topo II, and the structure-activity relationship indicated the halogen substituent in phenyl ring play an important role in the activity. Further mechanism studies revealed that CDCAs function as non-intercalative Topo II catalytic inhibitors. Moreover, some CDCAs showed micromolar cytotoxic activities.

Abstract: Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) is a recently discovered enzyme specifically repairing topoisomerase II (TOP2)-mediated DNA damage. It has been shown that inhibition of TDP2 synergize with TOP2 inhibitors. Herein, we report the discovery of the furoquinolinedione chemotype as a suitable skeleton for the development of selective TDP2 inhibitors. Compound 1 was identified as a TDP2 inhibitor as a result of screening our in-house compound library for compounds selective for TDP2 vs. TDP1. Further SAR studies provide several selective TDP2 inhibitors at low-micromolar range.

Synthesis and biological evaluation.  Abstract: Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects, among other areas, both sides of the Mediterranean Basin. The drugs classically used in clinical practice are pentavalent antimonials (SbV) and amphotericin B, which are nephrotoxic, require parenteral administration, and increasing drug resistance in visceral leishmaniasis has been observed. These circumstances justify the search of new families of compounds to find effective drugs against the disease. Eukaryotic type I DNA topoisomerase (TopIB) has been found essential for the viability of the parasites, and therefore represents a promising target in the development of an antileishmanial therapy. In this search, heterocyclic compounds, such as 1,5-naphthyridines, have been prepared by cycloaddition reaction between N-(3-pyridyl)aldimines and acetylenes and their antileishmanial activity on promastigotes and amastigote-infected splenocytes of Leishmania infantum has been evaluated. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of newly synthesized compounds were assessed on host murine splenocytes in order to calculate the corresponding selective indexes (SI). Excellent antileishmanial activity of 1,5-naphthyridine 19, 21, 22, 24 and 27 has been observed with similar activity than the standard drug amphotericin B and higher selective index (SI\\u202f>\\u202f100) towards L. infantum amastigotes than amphotericin B (SI\\u202f>\\u202f62.5). Special interest shows the 1,5-naphthyridine 22 with an IC50 value (0.58\\u202f±\\u202f0.03\\u202fμM) similar to the standard drug amphotericin B (0.32\\u202f±\\u202f0.05\\u202fμM) and with the highest selective index (SI\\u202f=\\u202f271.5). In addition, this compound shows remarkable inhibition on leishmanial TopIB. However, despite these interesting results, further studies are needed to disclose other potential targets involved in the antileishmanial effect of these novel compounds.', 'Title: Novel indolo-sophoridinic scaffold as Topo I inhibitors: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation as anticancer agents.  Abstract: Based on the mechanism of action, novel scaffolds as Topo I inhibitors bearing indole and sophoridinine were designed. Preliminary docking study revealed that some molecules among the designed series possessed promising Topo I inhibitor properties. Subsequently, thirty new compounds were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and Mass spectral analyses. The compounds were then screened for their antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibitory activities. The results affirmed the consistency between docking and activities and the rationality of the design strategy. Furthermore, compound 10b was chosen as a representative compound to test its anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that 10b caused prominent S phase cell cycle arrest and significantly suppressed tumor growth in HepG2 cell derived mouse model. These findings present a promising series of lead molecules which can serve as potential Topo I inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and a theoretical basis for structural modifications.', 'Title: A new phenolic series of indenopyridinone as topoisomerase inhibitors: Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships.

Abstract: This work describes the synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinylphosphine oxides, phosphanes and phosphine sulfides as well as that of quinolinylphosphine oxides and phosphine sulfides, which were synthesized in good to high overall yield. The synthetic route involves a multicomponent reaction of (2-phosphine-oxide)-, 2-phosphine- or (2-phosphine-sulfide)-aniline, aldehydes and olefins and allows the selective generation of two stereogenic centres in a short, efficient and reliable synthesis. The selective dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinylphosphine oxides and phosphine sulfides leads to the formation of corresponding phosphorus substituted quinolines.

Abstract: As part of our effort to develop potential topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) targeting anticancer agents, we systematically designed a new series of hydroxy and chloro-substituted 2,4-diphenyl 5H-chromeno[4,3-b]pyridines. Total eighteen compounds were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the function of topo I and IIα, and proliferation of human breast (T47D), colorectal (HCT15), and cervix (HeLa) cancer cells.

Abstract: Multitarget inhibitors design has generated great interest in cancer treatment. Based on the synergistic effects of topoisomerase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, we designed and synthesized a new series of acridine hydroxamic acid derivatives as potential novel dual Topo and HDAC inhibitors. MTT assays indicated that all the hybrid compounds displayed good antiproliferative activities with IC50 values in low micromolar range, among which compound 8c displayed potent activity against U937 (IC50\\u202f=\\u202f0.90\\u202fμM). In addition, compound 8c also displayed the best HDAC inhibitory activity, which was several times more potent than HDAC inhibitor SAHA. Subsequent studies indicated that all the compounds displayed Topo II inhibition activity at 50\\u202fμM. Moreover, compound 8c could interact with DNA and induce U937 apoptosis. This study provides a suite of compounds for further exploration of dual Topo and HDAC inhibitors, and compound 8c can be a new dual Topo and HDAC inhibitory anticancer agent.', 'Title: Development of 13H-benzo[f]chromeno[4,3-b][1,7]naphthyridines and their salts as potent cytotoxic agents and topoisomerase I/IIα inhibitors.  Abstract: A novel series of 35 angularly fused pentacyclic 13H-benzo[f]chromeno[4,3-b][1,7]naphthyridines and 13H-benzo[f]chromeno[4,3-b][1,7]naphthyridin-5-ium chlorides were designed and synthesized. Their cytotoxic activities were investigated against six human cancer cell lines (NCIH23, HCT15, NUGC-3, ACHN, PC-3, and MDA-MB-231). Among all screened compounds; 28, 30, 34, 35, 46, 48, 52, and 53 compounds exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against all tested human cancer cell lines. Further, these potent lead cytotoxic agents were evaluated against human Topoisomerase I and IIα inhibition. Among them, the compound 48 exhibited dual Topoisomerase I and IIα inhibition especially at 20\\u202fμM concentrations the compound 48 exhibited 1.25\\u202ftimes more potent Topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity (38.3%) than the reference drug etoposide (30.6%).

Abstract: Taking sophoridine as a lead compound, 58 sophoridine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity in the HepG2 cancer cell line. Among the 58 compounds, 33 compounds showed potent antiproliferative activity with IC50 less than 10\\u202fμM. Compound 5w showed the most potent anti-proliferative activity in the HepG2 cancer cell line. Thus, we further extended our characterization of the antiproliferative activity of 5w in six cancer cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721, Hela, CNE1, CNE2 and MCF7). The representative compound 5w displayed robust anti-proliferative activities in all the tested cell lines with IC50 values in range of 0.93-1.89\\u202fμM which were much lower than that of sophoridine. Here, we report the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in a sophoridine series of compounds, which indicated that introduction of N-benzyl indole group on the 14-carbon atom of sophoridine can significantly enhance the antiproliferative activity. By molecular docking and enzymatic assay, compound 5w was found to be able to inhibit the activity of DNA Topo I. Furthermore, apoptosis assay displayed that compound 5w could significantly induce the apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner by activating caspase-3, increasing expression of cleaved caspase-3 and reducing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The in vivo antitumor assay demonstrated that 5w suppressed the growth of HepG2 xenografts in nude mice without any obvious side effects.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of benzimidazole-rhodanine conjugates as potent topoisomerase II inhibitors.  Abstract: In this study, a series of benzimidazole-rhodanine conjugates were designed, synthesized and investigated for their topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitory and cytotoxic activities. The results from Topo II-mediated pBR322 DNA relaxation and cleavage assays showed that the synthesized compounds might act as Topo II catalytic inhibitors. Certain compounds displayed potent Topo II inhibition at 10 μM. The cytotoxic activities of these compounds against HeLa, A549, Raji, PC-3, MDA-MB-201, and HL-60 cancer cell lines were evaluated. The results indicated that these compounds exhibited strong antiproliferative activity. A good relationship was observed between the Topo II inhibitory potency and the cytotoxicity of these compounds. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the electronic effects, the phenyl group, and the rhodanine moiety were particularly important for the Topo II inhibitory potency and cytotoxicity.', 'Title: Application of Sequential Palladium Catalysis for the Discovery of Janus Kinase Inhibitors in the Benzo[ c]pyrrolo[2,3- h][1,6]naphthyridin-5-one (BPN) Series.  Abstract: The present account describes the discovery and development of a new benzo[ c]pyrrolo[2,3- h][1,6]naphthyridin-5-one (BPN) JAK inhibitory chemotype that has produced selective JAK inhibitors. Sequential palladium chemistry was optimized for the rapid access to a focused library of derivatives to explore the structure-activity relationships of the new scaffold. Several compounds from the series displayed potencies in the low nanomolar range against the four members of the JAK family with various selectivity profiles. Compound 20a, with an azetidine amide side chain, showed the best selectivity for JAK1 kinase vs JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, with low nanomolar potency (IC50 = 3.4 nM). On the other hand, BPNs 17b and 18 had good general activity against the JAK family with excellent kinome selectivity profiles. Many of the new BPNs inhibited JAK3-mediated STAT-5 phosphorylation, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and the proliferation of primary T cells. Moreover, BPN 17b showed very similar in vivo results to tofacitinib in a rheumatoid arthritis animal model.', 'Title: Design, facile synthesis and biological evaluations of novel pyrano[3,2-a]phenazine hybrid molecules as antitumor agents.  Abstract: A series of novel pyrano[3,2-a]phenazine derivatives (1a-1r and 2a-2q), designed as hybrid molecules of phenazine and pyran pharmocophores, were facilely synthesized in two steps with 77-93% overall yields in this study. Cytotoxic evaluation indicates that many compounds exhibited cytotoxicity against HCT116, MCF7, HepG2 and A549 cancer cell lines in vitro, in which compounds 1c, 1i, 2e, and 2l were found to have excellent antiproliferative activity against the HepG2 cancer cell line. Thus, inhibitory effect of subcutaneously implanted xenografted mice in vivo (H22H8D8 cells) of the four compounds as well as topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activities in vitro (HepG2 cells) were determined. Significantly, compound 1i showed more potent than positive control drug both in vivo and in vitro. Further mechanism studies against HepG2 cells in vitro revealed that compound 1i up-regulated the expression of both p53 and p21, which inhibited the expression of both cyclin B and CDK1, and arrested HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase. Concomitantly, after treating with compound 1i, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was significantly increased, the cytochrome C was released from mitochondria to cytosol, and the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression levels were both increased. Together, all these evidences implicated that compound 1i acts as topoisomerase I and IIα dual inhibitor, cell cycle arrester and apoptosis inducer against HepG2 cells.', 'Title: Design, facile synthesis and biological evaluations of novel pyrano[3,2-a]phenazine hybrid molecules as antitumor agents.

Abstract: In this study, two series of novel 4-(4-substituted amidobenzyl)furan-2(5H)-one derivatives containing an α,β-unsaturated lactone fragment were synthesized and screened for Topo I inhibition and antitumor activity. The topoisomerase I inhibitory activities and cytotoxicities against three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7,Hela,A549) were evaluated. The results revealed that series 2, compounds bearing an exocyclic double bond on the furanone ring, generally showed more potent activity than series 1, compounds lacking an exocyclic double bond. Several compounds of series 2 possess significant Topo I inhibitory activity and potent antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines. Further mechanism studies of the most active compound of series 2 (B-15) indicated that synthetic compounds can not only stabilize the drug-enzyme-DNA covalent ternary complex as well as camptothecin, but also interfere with the binding between Topo I and DNA.

Abstract: In this study, two series of novel 4-(4-substituted amidobenzyl)furan-2(5H)-one derivatives containing an α,β-unsaturated lactone fragment were synthesized and screened for Topo I inhibition and antitumor activity. The topoisomerase I inhibitory activities and cytotoxicities against three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7,Hela,A549) were evaluated. The results revealed that series 2, compounds bearing an exocyclic double bond on the furanone ring, generally showed more potent activity than series 1, compounds lacking an exocyclic double bond.

Abstract: Novel series of conformationally constrained 2,4-chloro- and hydroxy-substituted diphenyl benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridines were rationally designed and synthesized. Their biological activities were evaluated for topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activity, and antiproliferative activity against several human cancer cell lines for the development of novel anticancer agents. Most of the compounds with phenol moiety at 4-position of central pyridine exhibited significant dual topoisomerase I and II inhibitory activities, and strong antiproliferative activity in low micromolar range.

Abstract: A novel series of bis(hydroxymethyl)indolizino[8,7-b]indole hybrids composed of β-carboline (topoisomerase I/II inhibition) and bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrole (DNA cross-linking) are synthesized for antitumor evaluation. Of tumor cell lines tested, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines are the most sensitive to the newly synthesized compounds. These hybrids induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, trigger tumor cell apoptotic death, and display diverse mechanisms of action involving topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibition and induction of DNA cross-linking. Intriguingly, the substituent at N11 (H or Me) plays a critical role in modulating Topo II inhibition and DNA cross-linking activities. N11-Me derivatives predispose to induce DNA crosslinks, whereas N11-H derivatives potently inhibit Topo II. Computational analysis implicates that N11-Me restrict the torsion angles of the two adjacent OH on pyrrole resulting in a favorable of DNA cross-linking.

Abstract: Sorafenib was the only small-molecule drug approved by FDA for treatment of the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent study indicated that YM155 was a promising agent for HCC cells with high survivin expression, however, the antitumor activity needs to be further improved. Based on molecular docking and rational design method, a series of multi-substituted benzyl acridone derivatives were designed and synthesized. MTT assay indicated that some of the synthesized compounds displayed better antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells than YM155. Later study indicated that the representive compound 8u may directly interact with survivin protein and induce HepG2 cells apoptosis, which is different from YM155. In addition, ADME property was predicted in silico, and it performed well. Moreover, in vivo preliminary experiments showed that 8u may be a good lead compound in the treatment of HCC.', 'Title: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of the First Triple Inhibitors of Human Topoisomerase 1, Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1), and Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 2 (Tdp2).  Abstract: Tdp1 and Tdp2 are two tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases that can repair damaged DNA resulting from topoisomerase inhibitors and a variety of other DNA-damaging agents.

Abstract: A series of Hoechst 33258 based mono- and bisbenzimidazoles have been synthesized and their Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I inhibition, binding to B-DNA duplex, and antibacterial activity has been evaluated. Bisbenzimidazoles with alkynyl side chains display excellent E. coli DNA topoisomerase I inhibition properties with IC50 values <5.0 μM. Several bisbenzimidazoles (3, 6, 7, 8) also inhibit RNA topoisomerase activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. Bisbenzimidazoles inhibit bacterial growth much better than monobenzimidazoles for Gram-positive strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was much lower for Gram positive bacteria (Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., including two MRSA strains 0.3-8 μg/mL) than for the majority of Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16-32 μg/mL, Klebsiella pneumoniae > 32 μg/mL). Bisbenzimidazoles showed varied stabilization of B-DNA duplex (1.2-23.4 °C), and cytotoxicity studies show similar variation dependent upon the side chain length. Modeling studies suggest critical interactions between the inhibitor side chain and amino acids of the active site of DNA topoisomerase I.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of N-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-phenylalanine and N-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-aspartic acid-β-benzyl ester derivatives as potent topoisomerase IIα inhibitors.  Abstract: A new series of thirteen N-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-phenylalanine and N-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-aspartic acid-β-benzyl ester compounds were synthesized and evaluated for antiproliferative activity against four different human cancer cell lines: cervical cancer (HeLa), lung cancer (A549), gastric cancer (MGC-803) and breast cancer (MCF-7) as well as topoisomerase I and IIα inhibitory activity. Compounds (5a, 5b, 5e, 8a, 8b) showed significant antiproliferative activity with low IC50 values against the four cancer cell lines. Equally, compounds 5a, 5b, 5e, 5f, 8a, 8d, 8e and 8f showed topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity at 100μM with 5b, 5e, 8f exhibiting potential topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity compared to positive control at 100μM and 20μM, respectively. Conversely compounds 5e, 5f, 5g and 8a showed weaker topoisomerase I inhibitory activity compared to positive control at 100μM. Compound 5b exhibited the most potent topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity at low concentration and better antiproliferative activity against the four human cancer cell lines. The molecular interactions between compounds 5a-5g, 8a-8f and the topoisomerase IIα (PDB ID: 1ZXM) were further investigated through molecular docking.

Equally, compounds 5a, 5b, 5e, 5f, 8a, 8d, 8e and 8f showed topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity at 100μM with 5b, 5e, 8f exhibiting potential topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity compared to positive control at 100μM and 20μM, respectively. Conversely compounds 5e, 5f, 5g and 8a showed weaker topoisomerase I inhibitory activity compared to positive control at 100μM. Compound 5b exhibited the most potent topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity at low concentration and better antiproliferative activity against the four human cancer cell lines. The molecular interactions between compounds 5a-5g, 8a-8f and the topoisomerase IIα (PDB ID: 1ZXM) were further investigated through molecular docking. The results indicated that these compounds could serve as promising leads for further optimization as novel antitumor agents.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological research of novel azaacridine derivatives as potent DNA-binding ligands and topoisomerase II inhibitors.  Abstract: DNA and DNA-related enzymes are one of the most effective and common used intracellular anticancer targets in clinic and laboratory studies, however, most of DNA-targeting drugs suffered from toxic side effects. Development of new molecules with good antitumor activity and low side effects is important. Based on computer aided design and our previous studies, a series of novel azaacridine derivatives were synthesized as DNA and topoisomerases binding agents, among which compound 9 displayed the best antiproliferative activity with an IC50 value of 0.57μM against U937 cells, which was slightly better than m-AMSA. In addition, compound 9 displayed low cytotoxicity against human normal liver cells (QSG-7701), the IC50 of which was more than 3 times lower than m-AMSA. Later study indicated that all the compounds displayed topoisomerases II inhibition activity at 50μM. The representative compound 9 could bind with DNA and induce U937 apoptosis through the exogenous pathway.', 'Title: Design and Synthesis of Chlorinated and Fluorinated 7-Azaindenoisoquinolines as Potent Cytotoxic Anticancer Agents That Inhibit Topoisomerase I.  Abstract: The 7-azaindenoisoquinolines are cytotoxic topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors. Previously reported representatives bear a 3-nitro group. The present report documents the replacement of the potentially genotoxic 3-nitro group by 3-chloro and 3-fluoro substituents, resulting in compounds with high Top1 inhibitory activities and potent cytotoxicities in human cancer cell cultures and reduced lethality in an animal model. Some of the new Top1 inhibitors also possess moderate inhibitory activities against tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2), two enzymes that are involved in DNA damage repair resulting from Top1 inhibitors, and they produce significantly more DNA damage in cancer cells than in normal cells. Eighteen of the new compounds had cytotoxicity mean-graph midpoint (MGM) GI50 values in the submicromolar (0.033-0.630 μM) range. Compounds 16b and 17b are the most potent in human cancer cell cultures with MGM GI50 values of 0.063 and 0.033 μM, respectively. Possible binding modes to Top1 and TDP1were investigated by molecular modeling.', 'Title: Neutral Porphyrin Derivative Exerts Anticancer Activity by Targeting Cellular Topoisomerase I (Top1) and Promotes Apoptotic Cell Death without Stabilizing Top1-DNA Cleavage Complexes.  Abstract: Camptothecin (CPT) selectively traps topoisomerase 1-DNA cleavable complexes (Top1cc) to promote anticancer activity. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a new class of neutral porphyrin derivative 5,10-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-15, 20-bis(4-dimethylaminophenyl)porphyrin (compound 8) as a potent catalytic inhibitor of human Top1. In contrast to CPT, compound 8 reversibly binds with the free enzyme and inhibits the formation of Top1cc and promotes reversal of the preformed Top1cc with CPT. Compound 8 induced inhibition of Top1cc formation in live cells was substantiated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays. We established that MCF7 cells treated with compound 8 trigger proteasome-mediated Top1 degradation, accumulate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), PARP1 cleavage, oxidative DNA fragmentation, and stimulate apoptotic cell death without stabilizing apoptotic Top1-DNA cleavage complexes.

Abstract: With the aim to develop novel antiproliferative agents, a new series of eighteen dihydroxylated 2,6-diphenyl-4-chlorophenylpyridines were systematically designed, prepared, and investigated for their topoisomerase (topo) I and IIα inhibitory properties and antiproliferative effect in three different human cancer cell lines (HCT15, T47D, and HeLa). Compounds 22-30 which possess a meta- or para-phenol on 2-, or 6-position of central pyridine ring showed significant dual topo I and topo IIα inhibitory activities with strong antiproliferative activities against all the tested human cancer cell lines. However, compounds 13-21 which possess an ortho-phenol on 2-, or 6-position of central pyridine ring did not show significant topo I and topo IIα inhibitory activities but displayed moderate antiproliferative activities against all the tested human cancer cell lines. Compound 23 exhibited the highest antiproliferative potency as much as 348.5 and 105 times compared to etoposide and camptothecin, respectively, in T47D cancer cell line. The structure-activity relationship study revealed that the para position of a hydroxyl group at 2-and 6-phenyl ring and chlorine atom at the para position of 4-phenyl ring of the central pyridine exhibited the most significant topo I and topo IIα inhibition, which might indicate introduction of the chlorine atom at the phenyl ring of 4-pyridine have an important role as dual inhibitors of topo I and topo IIα.

Abstract: To discover new phenanthroindolizidine and phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids as potential anticancer drug candidates, non-natural 6-O-desmethylcryptopleurine (2) and its derivatives were prepared. Most of the new compounds exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against A549 and BEL-7402 cells, with the lowest IC50 being 3 nM. Optically pure 2-R was further evaluated against a panel of 30 cancer cell lines and found to inhibit the proliferation of all tested cell lines, including three multidrug-resistant cell lines, with an average IC50 value of 2.1 nM, which is much lower than that of previously reported phenanthroindolizidine DCB-3503 (1, IC50: 166.7 nM). A mechanistic evaluation showed that 2-R potently inhibited cell growth and colony formation, which are associated with a delay in S phase progression through the inhibition of DNA synthesis.

Abstract: Within this manuscript design, synthesis of novel 2-imidazolinyl substituted benzo[b]thieno-2-carboxamides bearing either benzimidazole or benzothiazole subunit and biological activity are presented and described. The antiproliferative activities were assessed in vitro on a panel of human cancer cell lines. Tested compounds showed moderate activity while cytotoxicity on normal fibroblasts was lower in comparison with 5-fluorouracile. The variations of 2-imidazolinyl substituent at heteroaromatic subunits in different positions led to different cytotoxic properties. The strongest selective activity against HeLa cells was observed for the benzothiazole derivative 4d with 2-imidazolinyl group at the benzo[b]thiophene subunit with a corresponding IC50 = 1.16 μM. Additionally, several biological experiments were performed to explain the mode of biological action. Fluorescence microscopy evidenced nuclear subcellular localization of compounds 3a, 4a and 4c.

Abstract: Molecules bearing indole nucleus present diverse biological properties such as antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities that can be associated both to DNA and protein interactions. This study focused on the synthesis of new indole derivatives with thiazolidines and imidazolidine rings condensed as side chains as well as the evaluation of their ability to interact with the DNA and antitumor and topoisomerase inhibition activities. All derivatives were successfully synthesized and their structures were elucidated by mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR), spectroscopy 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY 1H-1H and HSQC 1H-13C. The antitumor activity was evaluated against different cancer cell lines using the antiproliferative MTT assay. DNA binding ability was analyzed by absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence technique using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescent probe. Changes were observed in spectroscopic properties of the compounds after interacting with ctDNA (calf thymus DNA), with hypochromic and hyperchromic effects, besides blue or red shifts in the maxima of spectra. The indole derivative 5-(1H-Indol-3-ylmethylene)-thiazolidin-2,4-dione (4c) presented the best results in antitumor assay against the breast line tested (T47D), with IC50 value lower than the positive control, doxorubicin (1.93 and 4.61 μM, respectively). On the other hand, the compound 3-amino-5-(1H-indol-3-ylmethylene)-2-thioxo-thiazolidin-4-one (4a) was active against leukemia cell lines (HL60 and K562) with the high value of the DNA binding constant, Kb of 5.69 × 104. However, this compound (4a) did not inhibit the topoisomerase-I activity evaluated by relaxation assay. These results show that the indole nucleus contribute to the incorporation of molecules into the DNA. Moreover, it was highlighted that basic side chains, such as thiazolidines and imidazolidines, and free amino group, are relevant for design of promising antitumor and DNA binding compounds.', 'Genome wide protein coding siRNA screen for genes that enhance the effects of vemurafenib on cell viability and glycolysis in human BRAFV600 melanoma cells', 'Title: Identification of 3-(benzazol-2-yl)quinoxaline derivatives as potent anticancer compounds: Privileged structure-based design, synthesis, and bioactive evaluation in vitro and in vivo.  Abstract: Inspired by the common structural characteristics of numerous known antitumor compounds targeting DNA or topoisomerase I, 3-(benzazol-2-yl)-quinoxaline-based scaffold was designed via the combination of two important privileged structure units -quinoxaline and benzazole. Thirty novel 3-(benzazol-2-yl)-quinoxaline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities. The MTT assay indicated that most compounds possessed moderate to potent antiproliferation effects against MGC-803, HepG2, A549, HeLa, T-24 and WI-38\\u202fcell lines. 3-(Benzoxazol- -2-yl)-2-(N-3-dimethylaminopropyl)aminoquinoxaline (12a) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 1.49 to 10.99\\u202fμM against the five tested cancer and one normal cell line.

Western Blot analysis indicated that 12a-treatment could significantly up-regulate the levels of pro-apoptosis proteins Bak, Bax, and Bim, down-regulate anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and increase levels of cyclin B1 and CDKs inhibitor p21, cytochrome c, caspase-3, caspase-9 and their activated form in MGC-803\\u202fcells in a dose-dependent manner to induce cell apoptosis via a caspase-dependent intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway. Studies in MGC-803 xenograft tumors models demonstrated that 12a could signiﬁcantly reduce tumor growth in vivo at doses as low as 6\\u202fmg/kg with low toxicity. Its convenient preparation and potent anticancer efficacy in vivo makes the 3-(benzazol-2-yl)quinoxaline scaffold a promising new chemistry entity for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of pyrazole linked benzothiazole-β-naphthol derivatives as topoisomerase I inhibitors with DNA binding ability.  Abstract: A series of new pyrazole linked benzothiazole-β-naphthol derivatives were designed and synthesized using a simple, efficient and ecofriendly route under catalyst-free conditions in good to excellent yields. These derivatives were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on selected human cancer cell lines. Among those, the derivatives 4j, 4k and 4l exhibited considerable cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging between 4.63 and 5.54\\u202fµM against human cervical cancer cells (HeLa). Structure activity relationship was elucidated by varying different substituents on benzothiazoles and pyrazoles. Further, flow cytometric analysis revealed that these derivatives induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and spectroscopic studies such as UV-visible, fluorescence and circular dichroism studies showed that these derivatives exhibited good DNA binding affinity. Additionally, these derivatives can effectively inhibit the topoisomerase I activity. Viscosity studies and molecular docking studies demonstrated that the derivatives bind with the minor groove of the DNA.', 'Title: Discovery and Mechanistic Study of Tailor-Made Quinoline Derivatives as Topoisomerase 1 Poison with Potent Anticancer Activity.  Abstract: To overcome chemical limitations of camptothecin (CPT), we report design, synthesis, and validation of a quinoline-based novel class of topoisomerase 1 (Top1) inhibitors and establish that compound 28 ( N-(3-(1 H-imidazol-1-yl)propyl)-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)quinolin-4-amine) exhibits the highest potency in inhibiting human Top1 activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 29 ± 0.04 nM. Compound 28 traps Top1-DNA cleavage complexes (Top1ccs) both in the in vitro cleavage assays and in live cells. Point mutation of Top1-N722S fails to trap compound 28-induced Top1cc because of its inability to form a hydrogen bond with compound 28. Unlike CPT, compound 28 shows excellent plasma serum stability and is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein 1 (permeability glycoprotein) advancing its potential anticancer activity. Finally, we provide evidence that compound 28 overcomes the chemical instability of CPT in human breast adenocarcinoma cells through generation of persistent and less reversible Top1cc-induced DNA double-strand breaks as detected by γH2AX foci immunostaining after 5 h of drug removal.', 'Title: Discovery and Mechanistic Study of Tailor-Made Quinoline Derivatives as Topoisomerase 1 Poison with Potent Anticancer Activity.

Abstract: Fluoroquinolones substituted with N-1 biphenyl and napthyl groups were discovered to act as catalytically inhibitors of human topoisomerases I and II, and to possess anti-proliferative activity in vivo. Structural requirements for these novel quinolones to inhibit catalytic activity of human topoisomerase I have not been explored. In this work novel derivatives of the N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolone were designed, synthesized and evaluated to understand structural requirements of the C-3 carboxylic acid, C-6 fluorine, C-7 aminomethylpyrrolidine, C-8 methoxy, and the N-1 biphenyl functional groups for hTopoI inhibition. Characterization of each analog for inhibition of hTopoI catalytic inhibition reveals critical insight into structural requirements of these novel quinolones for activity. Additionally, results of DNA binding and modeling studies suggest that N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolones intercalate between the DNA base pairs with the N-1 biphenyl functional group, rather than the quinolone core, and that this mode of DNA intercalation contributes to inhibition of hTopoI by these novel structures. The results presented here support further development and evaluation of N-1 biphenyl fluoroquinolone analogs as a novel class of anti-cancer agents that act through catalytic inhibition of hTopoI.', 'Title: Probing structural requirements for human topoisomerase I inhibition by a novel N1-Biphenyl fluoroquinolone.

Abstract: Ganoderma lucidum is a multi-purpose plant medicine that is homologous to functional food. The most attractive properties of G. lucidum are its immunomodulatory and antitumour activities, which are mainly attributed to the following two major active components: G. lucidum polysaccharides and G. lucidum triterpenoids (GLTs). GLTs are effective as supplemental therapies and improve health when combined with other medications to treat hepatitis, fatigue syndrome, and prostate cancer. However, research investigating the mechanism and application of G. lucidum or GLTs in the treatment of diseases remains preliminary in terms of both the utilization efficacy and product type. This review offers comprehensive insight into the pharmacological activities of GLTs and their potential applications in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Specifically, 83 GLTs were selected, and their molecular structures and chemical formulas were described. We also describe 7 ganoderic acids that are currently at different stages of clinical trials (ganoderic acids A, C2, D, F, DM, X and Y). The related pharmacodynamic mechanisms and targeted signalling proteins were further analysed. Notably, the specific relationship between autophagy and apoptosis induced by ganoderic acid DM is summarized here for the first time.', 'Title: Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of HSP90 Inhibitor-SN38 Conjugates for Targeted Drug Accumulation.  Abstract: Herein, a series of HSP90 inhibitor-SN38 conjugates through ester and carbamate linkage in the 20-OH and 10-OH positions of SN38 were developed for improving the tumor-specific penetration and accumulation of SN38 via extracellular HSP90 (eHSP90)-mediated endocytosis. Mechanistic analyses confirmed that these novel conjugates could bind to eHSP90 and be selectively internalized into the tumor cells, which led to prolonged tumor regression in multiple models of cancer. Among all studied conjugates, compound 18b showed excellent in vitro activities, including acceptable HSP90α affinity and potent antitumor activity. Moreover, compound 18b exhibited superior antitumor activity and low toxicity in HCT116 and Capan-1 xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic analyses in HCT116 and Capan-1 xenografts further confirmed that compound 18b treatment could lead to effective cleavage and extended SN38 exposure at tumor sites.

Abstract: This work describes the synthesis of hybrid tetrahydro-1,5-naphthyridine and 1,5-naphthyridine derivatives fused with heterocycles such as chromenes and chromen-2-ones or coumarins, which were synthesized in good to high general yields. The synthetic route involves an intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition reaction of functionalized aldimines obtained by the condensation of 3-aminopyridine and aldehydes containing a double or triple carbon-carbon bond in orto position and allows the selective generation of three stereogenic centers in a short, efficient and reliable synthesis.

Abstract: 3-(Alkyl(dialkyl)amino)benzothieno[2,3-f]quinazolin-1(2H)-ones (4-9) have been designed using Ellipticine structure as a model, replacing the carbazole core and the pyridine ring with a dibenzothiophene and a pyrimidine moiety, respectively. New benzothienoquinazolinones (4-9) have been synthesized by a simple one-pot reaction employing 3-aminodibenzothiophene as starting material. The benzothienoquinazolinones obtained (4-9), were evaluated for their anticancer activity against two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The results revealed that compounds 4 and 7 presented a good antitumor activity toward the triple negative MDA-MB-231, without cytotoxicity against non-tumoral cells. Furthermore, the compounds 4 and 7 can be considered important molecular multi-target tools for their dual inhibition of different cellular proteins, i.e. Tubulin and human Topoisomerase I, involved in relevant cellular processes, as predicted by in silico studies and demonstrated by in vitro assays (for compound 4).', 'Title: Synthesis and biological evaluation of 5-aminoethyl benzophenanthridone derivatives as DNA topoisomerase IB inhibitors.

Special interest shows tetrahydroquinolylphosphine sulfide 5a with an EC<sub>50</sub> value (0.61\\u202f±\\u202f0.18\\u202fμM) similar to the standard drug amphotericin B (0.32\\u202f±\\u202f0.05\\u202fμM) and selective index (SI\\u202f=\\u202f56.87).

Abstract: A series of novel N-phenylbenzamide-4-methylamine acridine derivatives were designed and synthesized based initially on the structure of amsacrine (m-AMSA). Molecular docking suggested that the representative compound 9a had affinity for binding DNA topoisomerase (Topo) II, which was comparable with that of m-AMSA, and furthermore that 9a could have preferential interactions with Topo I. After synthesis of 9a and analogues 9b-9f, these were all tested in vitro and the synthesized compounds displayed potent antiproliferative activity against three different cancer cell lines (K562, CCRF-CEM and U937). Among them, compounds 9b, 9c and 9d exhibiting the highest activity with IC<sub>50</sub> value ranging from 0.82 to 0.91\\u202fμM against CCRF-CEM cells. In addition, 9b and 9d also showed high antiproliferative activity against U937 cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.33 and 0.23\\u202fμM, respectively. The pharmacological mechanistic studies of these compounds were evaluated by Topo I/II inhibition, western blot assay and cell apoptosis detection. In summary, 9b effectively inhibited the activity of Topo I/II and induced DNA damage in CCRF-CEM cells and, moreover, significantly induced cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations provide new information and guidance for the structural optimization of more novel acridine derivatives.', \"Title: Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase inhibitors: Progress and potential.  Abstract: DNA topoisomerases are essential during transcription and replication. The therapeutic mechanism of action of topoisomerase inhibitors is enzyme poisoning rather than catalytic inhibition. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases 1 or 2 were found as DNA repair enzymes hydrolyzing the covalent bond between the tyrosyl residue of topoisomerases I or II and the 3'- or 5'-phosphate groups in DNA, respectively. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 is a key enzyme in DNA repair machinery and a promising target for antitumor and neurodegenerative therapy. Inhibitors of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 could act synergistically with topoisomerase I inhibitors and thereby potentiate the effects of topoisomerase I poisons. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 is an enzyme that specifically repairs DNA damages induced by topoisomerase II poisons and causes resistance to these drugs. Selective inhibition of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 may be a novel approach to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to topoisomerase II-targeted drug therapy. Thus, agents that inhibit tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases 1 and 2 have many applications in biochemical and physiological research and they have the potential to become anticancer and antiviral drugs. The structures, mechanism of action and therapeutic rationale of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase inhibitors and their development for combinations with topoisomerase inhibitors and DNA damaging agents are discussed.\", 'Title: New anthra[2,3-b]furancarboxamides: A role of positioning of the carboxamide moiety in antitumor properties.  Abstract: Derivatives of the anthraquinone (anthracene-9,10-dione) such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and others have proved great clinical efficacy for decades. Currently the search in this exceptionally productive chemical class is aimed at optimization of antitumor properties including circumvention of drug resistance. Previously we have reported that heteroarene-fused anthraquinones fused to a 5-membered heterocyclic ring are advantageous in killing drug resistant tumor cells. Herein we present the synthesis and antitumor properties of a series of new anthra[2,3-b]furan-2-carboxamides. Vast majority of new derivatives were similarly cytotoxic to wild type tumor cell lines and their isogenic sublines with P-glycoprotein overexpression and/or p53 inactivation. Comparison of structurally close derivatives varying in their position relative to the furan moiety, that is, furan-3-carboxamide 1vs furan-2-carboxamides 5 and 6, revealed fundamental differences in the cytotoxicity profiles, formation of drug-DNA complexes, efficacy of topoisomerase 1 inhibition and mechanisms of tumor cell death. Together with previous SAR data on the role of individual substituents, these results provide evidence that regioisomerization of anthra[2,3-b]furancarboxamides generates the practically perspective derivatives whose properties may vary significantly.', 'Title: New anthra[2,3-b]furancarboxamides: A role of positioning of the carboxamide moiety in antitumor properties.

Abstract: Twenty novel aminophosphonates derivatives (5a-5j and 6a-6j) conjugated irinotecan were synthesized through esterification reaction, and evaluated their anticancer activities using MTT assay. In vitro evaluation revealed that they displayed similar or superior cytotoxicity compared to the positive drug irinotecan against A549, MCF-7, SK-OV-3, MG-63, U2OS and multidrug-resistant (MDR) SK-OV-3/CDDP cancer cell lines. Among them, 9b displayed the most potent activity, with IC values of 0.92-3.23 μM against five human cancer cells, which exhibited a 5.4-19.1-fold increase in activity compared to the reference drug irinotecan, respectively. Moreover, cellular mechanism studies suggested that 9b arrested cell cycle at S stage and induced cell apoptosis along with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Interestingly, 9b significantly inhibited tumor growth in SK-OV-3 xenograft models in vivo without apparent toxicity, which was better than the positive drug irinotecan.

Abstract: In order to develop potent anticaner agents, a novel series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2,3,3a,4-tetrahydrothiochromeno[4,3-c]pyrazole derivatives were synthesized. Structures of all compounds were confirmed. MTT assay has been employed to study antiproliferative activity of these compounds with four human cancer cell lines (MGC-803, Hela, MCF-7 and Bel-7404) and a normal cell line L929. Most of these compounds showed potential anticancer activity and low cytotoxicity on normal cell in vitro. 7d and 7f showed the best anticancer activity, whose IC value is 15.43 μM and 20.54 μM towards MGC-803, respectively. Most of them exhibited topoisomerase II selective inhibitory. Cleavage reaction assay and DNA unwinding assay showed that 7f was a nonintercalative Topo II catalytic inhibitor, which was consistent with the docking results. Laser scanning confocal microscopy system tracks the location of representative compounds 7d and 7f which can be abundantly entering the nucleus. In particular, the most potent compounds 7d and 7f were shown to be able to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MGC-803 cells.', \"Title: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Calothrixins B and their Deoxygenated Analogues.

In the present study, we attached saturated carbon atoms to the 10-position of camptothecin and synthesized 10 new camptothecin derivatives from 10-HCPT or SN-38. The activities of new compounds were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The most promising compound F10, 7-ethyl-10-(2-oxo-2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy)camptothecin, inhibited cancer cells growth with the IC of 0.002, 0.003, 0.011 and 0.081 μM on Raji, HCT116, A549 and Lovo cells, respectively. Meanwhile, oral administration of F10 remarkably suppressed the HCT116-xenograft tumor growth in the nude-mice model at the dosage of 0.5, 2.0 and 8.0 mg/kg in vivo. Intraperitoneal administration of F10 can completely inhibit Raji-xenograft tumor growth in established NPG mouse model at 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg. In addition, the minimum lethal doses of F10 and SN-38 in mice by intravenous administration were 80 and 40 mg/kg (or 0.155, 0.102 mmol/kg), respectively. The solubility of F10 reached 9.86 μg/mL in a buffer solution of pH 4.5. The oral bioavailability of F10 achieved 22.4% in mice.

The most promising compound F10, 7-ethyl-10-(2-oxo-2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy)camptothecin, inhibited cancer cells growth with the IC of 0.002, 0.003, 0.011 and 0.081 μM on Raji, HCT116, A549 and Lovo cells, respectively. Meanwhile, oral administration of F10 remarkably suppressed the HCT116-xenograft tumor growth in the nude-mice model at the dosage of 0.5, 2.0 and 8.0 mg/kg in vivo. Intraperitoneal administration of F10 can completely inhibit Raji-xenograft tumor growth in established NPG mouse model at 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg. In addition, the minimum lethal doses of F10 and SN-38 in mice by intravenous administration were 80 and 40 mg/kg (or 0.155, 0.102 mmol/kg), respectively. The solubility of F10 reached 9.86 μg/mL in a buffer solution of pH 4.5. The oral bioavailability of F10 achieved 22.4% in mice. The molecular docking model revealed that F10 can interact with topoisomerase I-DNA complex. Our findings indicate that F10 is a new orally-oavailable antitumor agent with potent anticancer effect. Furthermore, attaching a ring hydrophobic moiety to the 10-position of camptothecin provides a favorable approach in the optimization of camptothecin.', 'Title: Oligosaccharide-camptothecin conjugates as potential antineoplastic drugs: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.  Abstract: Thirty novel 20 (S)-O-linked camptothecin (CPT) glycoconjugates were synthesized. They showed more potent in vitro cytotoxicities over irinotecan, but very weak direct topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibition was observed at 100.0 μM. Oligosaccharide types, length of a PEG linker and acetyl groups exerted obvious effects on cytotoxicity, selectivity, water solubility and stability of the newly synthesized CPT glycoconjugates. Construct 40, with a bleomycin (BLM) disaccharide linked to diethylene glycol in the introduced ester moiety, demonstrated a superior antitumor activity and a distinct selectivity compared to CPT. No toxicity was detectable in animal acute toxicity intravenously (160 mg/kg). Collectively, attachment of oligosaccharides with tumor targeting to 20 (S)-OH of CPT could offer a solution to the daunting problems posed by current Topo I poisons.', 'Title: Oligosaccharide-camptothecin conjugates as potential antineoplastic drugs: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a copper(I)-catalyzed nitrile-addition/N-arylation ring-closure cascade for the synthesis of 5,11-dihydro-6H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-ones from 2-(2-bromophenyl)-N-(2-cyanophenyl)acetamides. Using CuBr and t-BuONa in dimethylformamide (DMF) as the optimal reaction conditions, the cascade reaction gave the target products, in high yields, with a good substrate scope. Application of the cascade reaction was demonstrated on the concise total syntheses of alkaloid isocryptolepine.

Abstract: The critical role of nuclear topoisomerase enzymes during cell proliferation process guided topoisomerases to be one of the major targets for anticancer drug development. We have designed and synthesized 22 heteroaromatic ring incorporated chalcone derivatives substituted with epoxide or thioepoxide. Topoisomerase enzyme inhibitory activity and cytotoxic tests were also conducted to evaluate compounds' pharmacological efficacy. In the topoisomerase I inhibitory test, compound 1 was most active one, 24% of inhibition at 20μM, among all the compounds but it was lower than camptothecin. Compounds 9, 11, and 13 inhibited the function of topoisomerase II more strongly than etoposide with almost same magnitude (around 90% and 30% inhibition at 100 and 20μM, respectively) which were higher than those of etoposide (72% and 18% inhibition). In the cytotoxicity test, compound 9 inhibited T47D cancer cell growth with the IC value of 6.61±0.21μM. On the other hand, compound 13 (IC: 4.32±0.18μM) effectively suppressed MDA-MB468 cancer cell growth.\", \"Title: Synthesis and topoisomerases inhibitory activity of heteroaromatic chalcones.

Abstract: Clinical use of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors is limited by several side effects due to weak isoform selectivity. Herein, a unique allosteric pocket of PDE5 is identified by molecular modeling and structural biology, which enables the discovery of highly selective PDE5 inhibitors from natural product evodiamine (EVO). The crystal structure of PDE5 with bound EVO derivative ( S )-7e revealed that binding of ( S )-7e to the novel allosteric pocket induced dramatic conformation changes in the H-loop with a maximum 24 Å movement of their Cα atoms. This movement directly blocks the binding of substrate/inhibitors to the PDE5 active site, which is different from all traditional PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. These derivatives showed >570-fold selectivity over PDE6C and PDE11A and achieved potent efficacy for the effective treatment of pulmonary hypertension in vivo.', 'Title: Design, synthesis, biological evaluation, QSAR analysis and molecular modelling of new thiazol-benzimidazoles as EGFR inhibitors.  Abstract: Heterocyclic rings such as thiazole and benzimidazole are considered as privileged structures, since they constitute several FDA-approved drugs for cancer treatment. In this work, a new set of 2-(2-(substituted) hydrazinyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl) thiazoles 4a-q were designed as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and synthesized using concise synthetic methods. The new target compounds have been evaluated in vitro for their suppression activity against EGFR TK. Compounds 4n, 4h, 4i, 4a and 4d exhibited significant potency in comparison with erlotinib which served as a reference drug (IC50, 71.67-152.59 nM; IC50 erlotinib, 152.59 nM). Furthermore, MTT assay revealed that compounds 4j, 4a, 4f, 4h, 4n produced the most promising cytotoxic potency against the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) (IC50; 5.96-11.91 µM; IC50 erlotinib; 4.15 µM). Compound 4a showed promising activity as EGFR TK inhibitor as well as anti-breast cancer agent. In addition, 4a induced apoptotic effect and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase preventing the mitotic cycle in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, 4a upregulated the oncogenic parameters; caspase-3, p53, Bax/Bcl-2 as well as it inhibited the level of PARP-1 enzyme. QSAR study was carried out for the new derivatives and it revealed the goodness of the models. Furthermore, molecular docking studies represented the binding modes of the promising compounds in the active pocket of EGFR.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and antitumor evaluation of new 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives targeting nuclear DNA.  Abstract: Four series of new 3-nitro naphthalimides derivatives, 4(4a‒4f), 5(5a‒5i), 6(6a‒6e) and 7 (7a‒7j), were designed and synthesized as antitumor agents. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) screening assay results revealed that some compounds displayed effective in vitro antiproliferative activity on SMMC-7721, T24, SKOV-3, A549 and MGC-803 cancer cell lines in comparison with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitonafide and amonafide.

Gel electrophoresis assay indicated that DNA and Topo I were the potential targets of compounds 6b and 7b, and comet assay confirmed that compounds 6b and 7b could induce DNA damage, while the further study showed that the 6b- and 7b-induced DNA damage was accompanied by the upregulation of p-ATM, P-Chk2, Cdc25A and p-H2AX. Cell cycle arrest studies demonstrated that compounds 6b and 7b arrested the cell cycle at the S phase, accompanied by the upregulation of the expression levels of the antioncogene p21 and the down-regulation of the expression levels of cyclin E.

Abstract: A novel series of benzimidazole derivatives with methoxylated aryl groups was designed and synthesized as molecules with potential cytotoxic activity. In vitro cytotoxic activity over HCT-116 cells showed that N-(benzimidazothiazolone)acetamides 11a, 11b and 11c were found to be the most cytotoxic compounds compared camptothecin (CPT). The tested compounds had a dual topoisomerase I-β (Topo I-β) and tubulin inhibiting activities when compared to CPT and Podophyllotoxin (Podo) where, compounds l0a, l0b, 11a and 11b exhibited a potent inhibitory activity on Topo I-β enzyme in nano-molar concentration, on the other hand, compounds 12b and 13b exhibited the best inhibitory activity β-tubulin polymerization. Results of the cell cycle analysis as well as the results of annexin-V on HCT-116 cells showed that benzimidazothiazoles 12b and 13b had a pro-apoptotic activity higher than CPT by 1.33- and 1.30-folds, respectively.

Abstract: Lamellarin D, a marine natural product, acts as a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I). To modify its physicochemical property and biological activity, a series of mono- and di-glycosylated derivatives were designed and synthesized through 22-26 multi-steps. Their inhibition of human Topo I was evaluated, and most of the glycosylated derivatives exhibited high potency in inhibiting Topo I activity as well as lamellarin D. All the 15 target compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines. The typical lamellarin derivative ZL-3 exhibited the best activity with IC values of 3 nM, 10 nM, and 15 nM against human lung cancer A549 cells, human colon cancer HCT116 cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Compound ZL-1 exhibited anti-cancer activity with IC of 14 nM and 24 nM against human colon cancer HCT116 cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, respectively. Cell cycle analysis in MDA-MB-231 suggested ZL-3 inhibited cell growth through arresting cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Further tests showed a significant improvement in aqueous solubility of ZL-1 and ZL-7. This study suggested that glycosylation could be utilized as a useful strategy to optimize lamellarin D derivatives as Topo I inhibitors and anticancer agents.', 'Title: Discovery of 4-alkoxy-2-aryl-6,7-dimethoxyquinolines as a new class of topoisomerase I inhibitors endowed with potent in vitro anticancer activity.  Abstract: In our attempt to develop potential anticancer agents targeting Topoisomerase I (TOP1), two novel series of 4-alkoxy-2-arylquinolines 14a-p and 19a-c were designed and synthesized based on structure activity relationships of the reported TOP1 inhibitors and structural features required for stabilization of TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes (TOP1ccs). The in vitro anticancer activity of these two series of compounds was evaluated at one dose level using NCI-60 cancer cell lines panel. Compounds 14e-h and 14m-p, with p-substituted phenyl at C2 and propyl linker at C4, were the most potent and were selected for assay at five doses level in which they exhibited potent anticancer activity at sub-micromolar level against diverse cancer cell lines. Compound 14m was the most potent with full panel GI MG-MID 1.26 μM and the most sensitive cancers were colon cancer, leukemia and melanoma with GI MG-MID 0.875, 0.904 and 0.926 μM, respectively. Melanoma (LOX IMVI) was the most sensitive cell line to all tested compounds displaying GI from 0.116 to 0.227 μM, TGI from 0.275 to 0.592 μM and LC at sub-micromolar concentration against almost of the tested compounds. Compounds 14e-h and 14m-p were assayed using TOP1-mediated DNA cleavage assay to evaluate their ability to stabilize TOP1ccs resulting in cancer cell death. The morpholino analogs 14h and 14p exhibited moderate TOP1 inhibitory activity compared to 1 μM camptothecin suggesting their use as lead compounds that can be optimized for the development of more potent anticancer agents with potential TOP1 inhibitory activity. Finally, Swiss ADME online web tool predicted that compounds 14h and 14p possessed good oral bioavailability and druglikeness characteristics.', 'Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of heterotetracyclic quinolinone derivatives as anticancer agents targeting topoisomerases.  Abstract: A series of thiochromeno[2,3-c]quinolin-12-one derivatives with various substitutions were synthesized and evaluated as topoisomerase (Topo) inhibitors. Six (8, 10, 12, 14, 19, and 26) of 23 compounds showed strong inhibitory activities against Topo-mediated DNA relaxation and proliferation of five human cell lines including breast (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7), colorectal (HCT116) and non-small cell lung (H1299) cancers. Among these, compounds 14 and 26 exhibited full inhibitory activities against Topo I at 3 μM and Topo IIα at 1 μM. Cancer cells treated with 26 accumulated DNA damage and were arrested at the G/M phase. With time, cells proceeded to apoptosis, as revealed by increased amounts of cells with fragmented DNA and cleavage of caspase-8 and -9. In contrast, normal breast epithelial cells showed low sensitivity to 26.

Six (8, 10, 12, 14, 19, and 26) of 23 compounds showed strong inhibitory activities against Topo-mediated DNA relaxation and proliferation of five human cell lines including breast (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7), colorectal (HCT116) and non-small cell lung (H1299) cancers. Among these, compounds 14 and 26 exhibited full inhibitory activities against Topo I at 3 μM and Topo IIα at 1 μM. Cancer cells treated with 26 accumulated DNA damage and were arrested at the G/M phase. With time, cells proceeded to apoptosis, as revealed by increased amounts of cells with fragmented DNA and cleavage of caspase-8 and -9.

Abstract: Heteroarene-fused anthraquinone derivatives represent a class of perspective anticancer drug candidates capable of targeting multiple vital processes including drug resistance. Taking advantage of previously demonstrated potential of amide derivatives of heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein dissected the role of the heterocyclic core in antitumor properties. A new series of naphtho[2,3-f]indole-3- and anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-3-carboxamides was synthesized via coupling the respective acids with cyclic diamines. New compounds demonstrated a submicromolar antiproliferative potency close to doxorubicin (Dox) against five tumor cell lines of various tissue origin. In contrast to Dox, the new compounds were similarly cytotoxic for HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (wild type p53) and their isogenic p53 knockout counterparts. Modification of the heterocyclic core changed the targeting properties: the best-in-series naphtho[2,3-f]indole-3-carboxamide 8 formed more affine complexes with DNA duplex than furan and thiophene analogs, a property that can be translated into a stronger inhibition of topoisomerase 1 mediated DNA unwinding. At tolerable doses the water soluble derivative 8 significantly inhibited tumor growth (up to 79%) and increased the lifespan (153%) of mice bearing P388 lymphoma transplants. Together with better solubility for parenteral administration and well tolerance by animals of the indole derivative 8 indicates prospects for further search of new antitumor drug candidates among the heteroarene-fused anthraquinones.', 'Title: Development of a metabolically stable topoisomerase I poison as anticancer agent.  Abstract: We have recently reported a new chemotype of a potent topoisomerase I poison with compound 1 as a potential anticancer chemotherapeutic agent.

Abstract: Natural products (NPs) have played a crucial role in the discovery and development of antitumor drugs. However, the high structural complexity of NPs generally results in unfavorable physicochemical profiles and poor drug-likeness. A powerful strategy to tackle this obstacle is the structural simplification of NPs by truncating nonessential structures. Herein, a series of tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives were designed by elimination of the D ring of NP evodiamine. Structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of compound 45, which displayed highly potent antitumor activity against all the tested cancer cell lines and excellent in vivo antitumor activity in the HCT116 xenograft model with low toxicity. Further mechanistic research indicated that compound 45 acted by dual Top1/2 inhibition and induced caspase-dependent cell apoptosis coupled with G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest.

In particular, while no clear inhibitory activity is observed for chromeno[4,3-b][1,8]naphthyridine fused heterocycles, a very different result is observed for quinolino[4,3-b][1,8]naphthyridine derivatives. Experimental assays indicated that quinolino[4,3-b][1,8]naphthyridines inhibited the topoisomerase I enzymatic reaction behaving like a poison, as occurs with the natural TopI inhibitor, camptothecin. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect on cell lines derived from human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3), and on non-cancerous lung fibroblasts cell line (MRC5) was also screened.', 'Title: Fused chromeno and quinolino[1,8]naphthyridines: Synthesis and biological evaluation as topoisomerase I inhibitors and antiproliferative agents.

Abstract: A new biological scaffold was produced by replacing the 6π-electron phenyl ring-B of a natural flavone skeleton with a 10π-electron benzothiophene (BT). Since aromatic rings are important for ligand protein interactions, this expansion of the π-electron system of ring-B might change the bioactivity profile. One of the resulting novel natural product-inspired compounds, 2-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)-5-hydroxy-7-isopropoxy-6-methoxyflavone (6), effectively arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and displayed significant antiproliferative effects with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.05-0.08 μM against multiple human tumor cell lines, including a multidrug resistant line. A structure-activity relationship study revealed that a 10π-electron system with high aromaticity, juxtaposed 4-oxo and 5-hydroxy groups, and 7-alkoxy groups were important for potent antimitotic activity.

Abstract: Long-term survivors of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are at high risk of developing second primary neoplasms, including leukemia. For these patients, the use of classic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate, is strongly discouraged, since this treatment causes a tremendous increase of tumor and stem cell migration and invasion. We aimed to develop agents useful for the treatment of patients with GBM and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using an alternative mechanism of action from the TKIs, specifically based on the inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Compounds 7 and 25, as planned, not only inhibited tubulin polymerization, but also inhibited the proliferation of both GMB and CML cells, including those expressing the T315I mutation, at nanomolar concentrations. In in vivo experiments in BALB/cnu/nu mice injected subcutaneously with U87MG cells, in vivo, 7 significantly inhibited GBM cancer cell proliferation, in vivo tumorigenesis, and tumor growth, tumorigenesis and angiogenesis.

Abstract: The anthraquinone scaffold has long been known as a source of efficacious antitumor drugs. In particular, the various chemical modifications of the side chains in this scaffold have yielded the compounds potent for the wild type tumor cells, their counterparts with molecular determinants of altered drug response, as well as in vivo settings. Further exploring the chemotype of anticancer heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein demonstrate that derivative of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, (compound 8) is highly potent against a panel of human tumor cell lines and their drug resistant variants. Treatment with submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations of 8 for only 30 min was sufficient to trigger lethal damage of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Compound 8 (2.5 μM, 3-6 h) induced an apoptotic cell death as determined by concomitant activation of caspases 3 and 9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, increase of Annexin V/propidium iodide double stained cells, DNA fragmentation (subG1 fraction) and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Neither a significant interaction with double stranded DNA nor strong inhibition of the DNA dependent enzyme topoisomerase 1 by 8 were detectable in cell free systems. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that some amount of 8 was detectable in mitochondria as early as 5 min after the addition to the cells; exposure for 1 h caused significant morphological changes and clustering of mitochondria. The bioisosteric analog 2 in which the thiophene ring was replaced with furan was less active although the patterns of cytotoxicity of both derivatives were similar. These results point at the specific role of the sulfur atom in the antitumor properties of carboxamide derivatives of heteroarene-fused anthraquinone.', 'Title: Discovery of Oral Anticancer 1,2-Bis(hydroxymethyl)benzo[<i>g</i>]pyrrolo[2,1-<i>a</i>]phthalazine Hybrids That Inhibit Angiogenesis and Induce DNA Cross-Links.  Abstract: Designing hybrid molecules with dual functions is one approach to improve the therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment. We have previously conjugated phthalazine and bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrole pharmacophores to form hybrids bearing antiangiogenesis and DNA interstrand cross-linking activities. To improve the bioavailability, we adopted a benzology approach to design and synthesize a new series of 1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzo[<i>g</i>]pyrrolo[2,1-<i>a</i>]phthalazines. These new hybrids retained the dual functions and could be formulated into vehicles for intravenous and oral administration. Among them, we demonstrated that compound <b>19a</b> with dimethylamine at the C6 position markedly suppressed the tumor growth of human small cell lung cancer cell line H526, squamous lung cancer cell line H520, and renal cancer cell line 786-O in nude mice, implying that compound <b>19a</b> is a broad-spectrum anticancer agent. Our results implicated that the conjugation of antiangiogenic and DNA cross-linking is likely to be a helpful approach to improving the efficacy of combination therapy.', 'Human topoisomerase I relaxation assays were carried out with 0.5 U of enzyme in reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer.

Abstract: A diselenide/disulfide unit was introduced into camptothecin (CPT), and two selenoprodrugs (e.g., CPT-Se3 and CPT-Se4) were identified to show improved potency in killing cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Interestingly, the intrinsic fluorescence of CPT was severely quenched by the diselenide bond. Both the selenoprodrugs were activated by glutathione with a nearly complete recovery of CPT's fluorescence. The activation of prodrugs was accompanied by the production of selenol intermediates, which catalyzed the constant conversion of glutathione and oxygen to oxidized glutathione and superoxides. The diselenide unit is widely employed in constructing thiol-responsive materials. However, the selenol intermediates were largely ignored in the activation process prior to this study. Our work verified that integration of the diselenide unit may further enhance the parent drug's efficacy. Also, the discovery of the fluorescence quenching property of the diselenide/disulfide bond further shed light on constructing novel theranostic agents.\", 'Title: New Dibenzoquinoxalines Inhibit Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Growth by Dual Targeting of Topoisomerase 1 and the <i>c-MYC</i> G-Quadruplex.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal brain tumors. The crucial chemotherapy is mainly alkylating agents with modest clinical success. Given this desperate need and inspired by the encouraging results of a phase II trial via concomitant Topo I inhibitor plus COX-2 inhibitor, we designed a series of N-2-(phenylamino) benzamide derivatives as novel anti-glioblastoma agents based on structure modification on 1,5-naphthyridine derivatives (Topo I inhibitors). Notably, the target compounds I-1 (33.61 ± 1.15 μM) and I-8 (45.01 ± 2.37 μM) were confirmed to inhibit COX-2, while a previous reported compound (1,5-naphthyridine derivative) resulted nearly inactive towards COX-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 150 μM). Besides, I-1 and I-8 exhibited higher anti-proliferation, anti-migration, anti-invasion effects than the parent compound 1,5-naphthyridine derivative, suggesting the success of modification based on the parent. Moreover, I-1 obviously repressed tumor growth in the C6 glioma orthotopic model (TGI = 66.7%) and U87MG xenograft model (TGI = 69.4%).

Abstract: As a recently discovered DNA repair enzyme, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) removes topoisomerase IB (TOP1)-mediated DNA protein cross-links. Inhibiting TDP1 can potentiate the cytotoxicity of TOP1 inhibitors and overcome cancer cell resistance to TOP1 inhibitors. On the basis of our previous study, herein we report the synthesis of benzophenanthridinone derivatives as TOP1 and TDP1 inhibitors. Seven compounds (<b>C2</b>, <b>C4</b>, <b>C5</b>, <b>C7</b>, <b>C8</b>, <b>C12</b>, and <b>C14</b>) showed a robust TOP1 inhibitory activity (+++ or ++++), and four compounds (<b>A13</b>, <b>C12</b>, <b>C13</b>, and <b>C26</b>) showed a TDP1 inhibition (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 15 or 19 μM). We also show that the dual TOP1 and TDP1 inhibitor <b>C12</b> induces both cellular TOP1cc, TDP1cc formation and DNA damage, resulting in cancer cell apoptosis at a sub-micromolar concentration. In addition, <b>C12</b> showed an enhanced activity in drug-resistant MCF-7/TDP1 cancer cells and was synergistic with topotecan in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/TDP1 cells.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and bioactivity evaluation of novel evodiamine derivatives with excellent potency against gastric cancer.  Abstract: Gastric cancer represents a significant health burden worldwide. Previously, inspired by the traditional Chinese medicine Wu-Chu-Yu to treat the spleen and stomach system for thousands of years, we identified N14-phenyl substituted evodiamine derivatives as potential antitumor agents with favorable inhibition on Top1. Herein, structural optimization and structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) led us to discovering a highly active evodiamine derivative compound 6t against gastric cancer. Further anti-tumor mechanism studies revealed that compound 6t played as the inhibition of topoisomerase 1 (Top1), effectively induced apoptosis, obviously arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the compound 6t was low toxicity in vivo and exhibited excellent anti-tumor activity (TGI = 70.12%) in the MGC-803 xenograft models. In summary, compound 6t represents a promising candidate as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against gastric cancer.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and bioactivity evaluation of novel evodiamine derivatives with excellent potency against gastric cancer.

Herein, structural optimization and structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) led us to discovering a highly active evodiamine derivative compound 6t against gastric cancer. Further anti-tumor mechanism studies revealed that compound 6t played as the inhibition of topoisomerase 1 (Top1), effectively induced apoptosis, obviously arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the compound 6t was low toxicity in vivo and exhibited excellent anti-tumor activity (TGI = 70.12%) in the MGC-803 xenograft models. In summary, compound 6t represents a promising candidate as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against gastric cancer.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and bioactivity evaluation of novel evodiamine derivatives with excellent potency against gastric cancer.

Abstract: A series of novel 7-substituted 10,11-methylenedioxy-camptothecin (FL118) derivatives were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. All the FL118 analogues showed significant cytotoxic activities in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar range and were more potent than topotecan. The most active compound 9c exhibited more significant anti-tumor activity against small-cell lung cancer (NCI-H446, H69, drug-resistant H69AR cells, drug-resistant NCI-H446/Irinotecan cells and drug-resistant NCI-H446/EP cells) in vitro. Additionally, 9c could also induce the expression of apoptosis proteins such as caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP in small-cell lung cancer. Further studies showed that 9c induced apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, XIAP and survivin in small-cell lung cancer. In vivo9c also showed better anti-tumor efficacy, with the tumor growth inhibition rates were 40.4% (0.75 mg/kg), 73.7% (1.5 mg/kg), and 95.5% (3 mg/kg). It is noteworthy that 9c also demonstrated potent inhibition of drug-resistant tumor growth in NCI-H446/Irinotecan and NCI-H446/EP xenograft models, the tumor growth inhibition rates were 93.42% and 84.46%, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicated that compound 9c displays outstanding antitumor activity and drug-resistance in small-cell lung cancer both in vivo and in vitro, which could be worth further research as a novel anti-tumor drug against small-cell lung cancer.', 'Title: Paradigm shift of \"classical\" HDAC inhibitors to \"hybrid\" HDAC inhibitors in therapeutic interventions.  Abstract: \\'Epigenetic\\' regulation of genes via post-translational modulation of proteins is the current mainstay approach for the disease therapies, particularly explored in the Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) class of enzymes. Mainly sight saw in cancer chemotherapeutics, HDAC inhibitors have also found a promising role in other diseases (neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infections) and successfully entered in various combination therapies (pre-clinical/clinical stages). The prevalent flexibility in the structural design of HDAC inhibitors makes them easily tuneable to merge with other pharmacophore modules for generating multi-targeted single hybrids as a novel tactic to overcome drawbacks of polypharmacy. Herein, we reviewed the putative role of prevalent HDAC hybrids inhibitors in the current and prospective stage as a translational approach to overcome the limitations of the existing conventional drug candidates (parent molecule) when used either alone (drug resistance, solubility issues, adverse side effects, selectivity profile) or in combination (pharmacokinetic interactions, patient compliance) for treating various diseases.', \"Title: Topoisomerase I inhibitors: Challenges, progress and the road ahead.

This review aims to provide chronological development of different classes of Top1 poisons from both natural and synthetic sources through strategic structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis with insight into the important structural features in different chemotypes that imparted Top1 inhibition along with the understanding of the structural basis of inhibition.

CMs 1 and 2 are new dimeric alkaloids whose piperidine matrine ring is cleaved and connected via the N'-1 bond. Their chemical structures have been confirmed by IR, UV, HR-ESI-MS, and NMR. Preliminary screening shows that they have topoisomerase I (Topo I)-based anti-tumor activity. Their Topo I inhibitory activities and mechanism have been evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis assay and a molecular docking study. The results show that the inhibition rate of CM 1 is 82.26% at 1 mM concentration and that it exhibits significantly Topo I inhibitory activity.

Abstract: β-Carbolines are indole alkaloids having a tricyclic pyrido[3,4-b]indole ring in their structure. Since the isolation of first β-carboline from Peganum harmala in 1841, the isolation and synthesis of various β-carboline derivatives surged in the following centuries. β-Carboline derivatives due to their widespread availability from natural sources, structural flexibility, quick reactivity and interaction with varied anticancer targets such as DNA (intercalation, groove binding, etc.), enzymes (GPX4, topoisomerases, kinases, etc.) and proteins (tubulin, ABCG2/BRCP1, etc.) have established themselves as promising lead compounds for the synthesis of various anticancer active agents. The current review covers the synthesis and isolation, anticancer activity, mechanism of action and SAR of various β-carboline containing molecules, its derivatives and congeners.', 'Title: Design, synthesis and anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity of 3-arylisoquinoline alkaloids.  Abstract: This article describes the syntheses and biological activity of five 3-arylisoquinoline natural products corydamine (1), N-formyl Corydamine (2), hypecumine (3), Decumbenine B (XW) and 2-(1,3-dioxolo [4,5-h]isoquinolin-7-yl)-4,5-dimethoxy-N-methyl-Benzeneethanamine (A), and twelve analogues. Among them, 1, 2, and A were synthesized for the first time. In vitro screening for anti-proliferative activity showed that derivative 1a could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.82 μM on Huh7 cells and 6.83 μM on LM9 cells), and arrest cell cycle at G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. The mechanistic studies further suggested compound 1a was a dual inhibitor of Topo I and Topo II, and Topo II inhibitory activity was superior to etoposide. In addition, 1a could significantly inhibit the invasion and migration of cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9, and induce apoptosis through inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated 1a could obviously reduce the growth of xenograft tumor and possessed good pharmacokinetic parameters, which indicated the potential value of 1a in treating liver cancer.', 'Title: Development of oxoisoaporphine derivatives with topoisomerase I inhibition and reversal of multidrug resistance in breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells.  Abstract: A series of oxoisoaporphine derivatives with topoisomerase I inhibition and cytotoxic activities. Among them, compound 14 showed the most potent cytotoxic activity against all cancer cell lines tested, and substantially lower cytotoxicity to LO2 cells. Molecular docking studies, dynamics simulation and a follow-up enzyme inhibition assay indicated that 14 could interfere with DNA and significantly inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I. Further mechanistic studies revealed that 14 could arrest cell cycle at the G1 phase, and finally killed MCF-7 cells via apoptosis. In addition, 14 exhibited remarkable chemoreversal ability on multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells. Some of its mechanisms may be related to inhibition of MCF-7/ADR P-gp-mediated Rhodamine (Rh123) efflux function and expression level, as well as inhibition of ROS, increase of ADR accumulation in MCF7/ADR cells, and enhancement of ADR in inducing apoptosis of MCF7/ADR cells. As 14 has little toxic and side effects, it may have the potential for further research.', 'Title: Optimization of the Natural Product Calothrixin A to Discover Novel Dual Topoisomerase I and II Inhibitors with Improved Anticancer Activity.
