Description:

To identify additional clock genes and modifiers, we conducted a genome-wide screen of ~90,000 siRNAs (QIAGEN Inc) in a human cellular model of clock function. Knockdown of nearly a thousand genes reduced
rhythm amplitude; these are presumably due to toxic effects on cells. Hundreds of genes potently modified period length or increased amplitude.

Title: Bisindolylmaleimides linked to DNA minor groove binding lexitropsins: synthesis, inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I, and biological evaluation.

Abstract: The synthesis, characterization, inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I, and biological evaluation of a series of oligopeptide-substituted bisindolylmaleimides 7-12 are described. Compounds 7-9, which contain a basic C-terminus function such as (dimethylamino)propyl and bind to DNA with C(50) values of 200, 160, and 135 microM, respectively, exhibited inhibition of topoisomerase I in a concentration dependent manner. Also, the relative order of observed topoisomerase I inhibition is 9 > 8 > 7 at < or = 100 microM concentration, corresponding to the increase of the number of pyrrole units in the oligopeptide moiety. Compounds 10-12, which contain an electrostatically neutral moiety, such as methyl ester, did not bind to DNA templates nor inhibit topoisomerase I. However, the cytotoxicity activities of these compounds were 1.5 times greater than those of compounds 7-9.

Also, the relative order of observed topoisomerase I inhibition is 9 > 8 > 7 at < or = 100 microM concentration, corresponding to the increase of the number of pyrrole units in the oligopeptide moiety. Compounds 10-12, which contain an electrostatically neutral moiety, such as methyl ester, did not bind to DNA templates nor inhibit topoisomerase I. However, the cytotoxicity activities of these compounds were 1.5 times greater than those of compounds 7-9.

Title: seco-Cyclothialidines: new concise synthesis, inhibitory activity toward bacterial and human DNA topoisomerases, and antibacterial properties.

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.

Title: Inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 helicase-primase by (dichloroanilino)purines and -pyrimidines.

Abstract: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) encodes a heterotrimeric helicase-primase comprised of the products of three of the seven DNA replication-specific genes. Several dihalo-substituted derivatives of N2-phenylguanines and 2-anilinoadenines weakly inhibited the intrinsic DNA-dependent NTPase activity of the HSV1 helicase-primase, and these compounds inhibited the DNA-unwinding activity of the enzyme. The primase activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by 3,4- and 3,5-dichloroanilino derivatives of adenine and 2-aminopyrimidines. These compounds and nucleoside analogs of 2-(3,5-dichloroanilino)purines inhibited viral DNA synthesis in HSV1-infected HeLa cells in culture but also inhibited cellular DNA synthesis, likely as a result of inhibition of cellular primase and/or DNA polymerases.

Title: Quantized surface complementarity diversity (QSCD): a model based on small molecule-target complementarity.

Abstract: A model of molecular diversity is presented. The model, termed "Quantized Surface Complementarity Diversity" (QSCD), defines molecular diversity by measuring molecular complementarity to a fully enumerated set of theoretical target surfaces. Molecular diversity space is defined as the molecular complement to this set of enumerated surfaces. Using a set of known test compounds, the model is shown to be biologically relevant, consistently scoring known actives as similar. At the resolution of the model, which examines molecules "quantized" into 4.24 A cubic units and treats four points of specific energetic complementarity, the minimum number of compounds needed to fully cover molecular diversity space up to volume 1070 cubic A is estimated to be on the order of 24 million molecules. Most importantly, QSCD allows for individual points in diversity space to be filled by direct modeling of molecular libraries into detailed 3D templates of shape and functionality.

Title: Synthesis of water-soluble (aminoalkyl)camptothecin analogues: inhibition of topoisomerase I and antitumor activity.

Abstract: Water-soluble analogues of the antitumor alkaloid camptothecin (1) were prepared in which aminoalkyl groups were introduced into ring A or B. Most of the analogues were prepared by oxidation of camptothecin to 10-hydroxycamptothecin (2) followed by a Mannich reaction to give N-substituted 9-(aminomethyl)-10-hydroxycamptothecins (4-12) or by subsequent modification of Mannich product 4 (13, 15, 17, 19, 21). Others were obtained by modification of the hydroxyl group of 2 (25,26) or by total synthesis (35,42,43). These analogues, as well as some of their synthetic precursors, were evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I, cytotoxicity, and antitumor activity. Although there was not a quantitative correlation between these assays, compounds that inhibited topoisomerase I were also cytotoxic and demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo. Further evaluation of the most active water-soluble analogue led to the selection of 9-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-10-hydroxycamptothecin (4, SK&F 104864) for development as an antitumor agent. In addition to its water solubility, ease of synthesis from natural camptothecin, and high potency, 4 demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in preclinical tumor models and is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.

Title: Modification of the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin: inhibition of mammalian topoisomerase I and biological activity.

Abstract: Several camptothecin derivatives containing a modified hydroxy lactone ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of topoisomerase I and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Each of the groups of the hydroxy lactone moiety, the carbonyl oxygen, the ring lactone oxygen, and the 20-hydroxy group, were shown to be critical for enzyme inhibition. For example the lactol, lactam, thiolactone, and 20-deoxy derivatives did not stabilize the covalent DNA-topoisomerase I complex. With a few exceptions, those compounds that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were not cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Two cytotoxic derivatives that did not inhibit topoisomerase I were shown to produce non-protein-associated DNA single-strand breaks and are likely to have a different mechanism of action. One of these compounds was tested for antitumor activity and was found to be inactive. The present findings, as well as other reports that the hydroxy lactone ring of camptothecin is critical for antitumor activity in vivo, correlate with the structure-activity relationships at the level of topoisomerase I and support the hypothesis that antitumor activity is related to inhibition of this target enzyme.

Title: Water soluble inhibitors of topoisomerase I: quaternary salt derivatives of camptothecin.

Abstract: Eleven water soluble 7-substituted quaternary ammonium salt derivatives of 10,11-(methylenedioxy)- and 10,11-(ethylenedioxy)-(20S)-camptothecin were synthesized via the Friedlander reaction followed by nucleophilic displacement with an aromatic amine. All of these compounds were more potent than camptothecin in the in vitro cleavable complex assay. These inherently charged camptothecin derivatives were cytotoxic against three different human tumor cell lines (SKOV3, an ovarian adenocarcinoma; SKVLB a multidrug resistant ovarian adenocarcinoma; and HT-29, a colon carcinoma). A selected group of five compounds was evaluated in the nude mouse HT-29 xenograft model. Two of these quaternary salts (17 and 18) were more efficacious than Topotecan in delaying tumor growth. In an extended in vivo model, 18 demonstrated tumor regression.

Title: Synthesis and antitumor activity of novel water soluble derivatives of camptothecin as specific inhibitors of topoisomerase I.

Abstract: The synthesis and antitumor activities of the novel water soluble camptothecin derivatives 7-[(4-methylpiperazino)methyl]-10,11-(methylenedioxy)-(20S)-campto thecin trifluoroacetate (6) and 7-[(4-methylpiperazino)methyl]-10,11-(ethylenedioxy)-(20S)-camptot hecin trifluoroacetate (7) are described. The solubilities of compounds 6 and 7 were measured to be 4.5 and 5.8 mg/mL, respectively, in pH 5 acetate buffer in contrast to < 0.003 mg/mL for camptothecin in the same buffer. In the purified topoisomerase I cleavable complex enzyme assay, compounds 6 and 7 demonstrated potent inhibition of topoisomerase I with IC50's of 300 and 416 nM, respectively, in comparison to 679 nM for camptothecin and 1028 nM for topotecan. In human tumor cell cytotoxicity assays, compounds 6 and 7 demonstrated potent antitumor activity against ovarian (SKOV3), ovarian with upregulated MDRp-glycoprotein (SKVLB), melanoma (LOX), breast (T47D), and colon (HT29) with IC50's ranging from 0.5 to 102 nM. Compounds 6 and 7 induced tumor regressions in the HT29 human colon tumor xenograft model and demonstrated similar rank order of potency compared to in vitro assay results.

Title: Antiretroviral agents as inhibitors of both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase and protease.

Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type one integrase (HIV-1 integrase) is required for integration of a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into a host chromosome and for HIV replication. We have previously reported that phenolic moieties in compounds such as flavones, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), tyrphostins, and curcumin confer inhibitory activity against HIV-1 integrase. We have investigated the actions of several recently described protease inhibitors, possessing novel structural features, on HIV-1 integrase. NSC 158393, which contains four 4-hydroxycoumarin residues, was found to exhibit antiviral, antiprotease, and antiintegrase activity. Both the DNA binding and catalytic activities (3'-processing and strand transfer) of integrase were inhibited at micromolar concentrations. Disintegration catalyzed by an integrase mutant containing only the central catalytic domain was also inhibited, indicating that the binding site for these compounds resides in the central 50-212 amino acids of HIV-1 integrase. Binding at or near the integrase catalytic site was also suggested by a global inhibition of the choice of attacking nucleophile in the 3'-processing reaction. NSC 158393 inhibited HIV-2, feline, and simian immunodeficiency virus integrases while eukaryotic topoisomerase I was inhibited at higher concentrations, suggesting selective inhibition of retroviral integrases. Molecular modeling studies revealed that the two hydroxyls and two carbonyl moieties in NSC 158393 may represent essential elements of the pharmacophore. Antiviral efficacy was observed with NSC 158393 derivatives that inhibited both HIV protease and integrase, and the most potent integrase inhibitors also inhibited HIV protease. Hydroxycoumarins may provide lead compounds for development of novel antiviral agents based upon the concurrent inhibition of two viral targets, HIV-1 integrase and protease.

Title: Synthesis, topoisomerase I inhibition and structure-activity relationship study of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridine derivatives.

Abstract: For the development of new anticancer agents, phenyl, 2-pyridyl, 2-furyl, 2-thienyl, 2-furylvinyl and 2-thienylvinyl substituted derivatives on 2,4,6-position in pyridine moiety were prepared and evaluated for their topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Among the thirteen prepared compounds, four compounds exhibited strong topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. A structure-activity relationship study indicated that the 2-thienyl-4-furylpyridine skeleton was important for topoisomerase I inhibitory activity.

Title: Synthesis, topoisomerase I inhibitory activity, and in vivo evaluation of 11-azacamptothecin analogs.

Abstract: A series of analogs based on a novel template, 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin, were obtained from total synthesis and tested as potential anticancer drugs in the topoisomerase I enzyme cleavable complex assay. The parent compound 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin (8) was derived from a Friedlander condensation between the known aminopyridine derivative 3-(3-amino-4-picolylidene)-p-toluidine and optically active tricyclic ketone 7. Compound 8 had activity approximately twice that of (20S)-camptothecin in the calf thymus topoisomerase I cleavable complex assay. Compounds were prepared wherein the 11-aza nitrogen atom was quaternized as either the corresponding N-oxide or methyl iodide. Compounds with quaternized N-11 showed improved water solubility and were equipotent to the clinically investigated camptothecin analog topotecan in the cleavable complex assay. These compounds were evaluated in vivo in nude mice bearing HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenografts. The analog 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin 11-N-oxide was found to significantly retard tumor growth when compared to untreated controls. Finally, 7,10-disubstituted 11-azacamptothecin analogs were synthesized using Pd(0) coupling reactions of 10-bromo-7-alkyl-11-aza-(20S)-camptothecins 19 and 20, which in turn were available from a Friedlander condensation of the novel bromopyridine derivatives 17a and 17b with 7. Among the 10-substituted series, a number of analogs displayed extremely high in vitro potency against topoisomerase I and improved aqueous solubility. A significant number of the compounds were found to be active in whole cell cytotoxicity assays and several were evaluated in nude mice bearing the HT-29 tumor xenografts. The most effective of these proved to be (S)-11-aza-7-ethyl-10-(aminohydroximinomethyl)camptothecin trifluoracetic acid salt (27), a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor which demonstrated excellent efficacy in both short term and in extended in vivo assays. A comparison between in vitro enzyme data and in vivo data from nude mouse studies in other compounds in this series revealed a poor overall correlation between topoisomerase inhibition in vitro and antitumor efficacy in vivo.

Title: Synthesis, topoisomerase I inhibitory activity, and in vivo evaluation of 11-azacamptothecin analogs.

Abstract: A series of analogs based on a novel template, 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin, were obtained from total synthesis and tested as potential anticancer drugs in the topoisomerase I enzyme cleavable complex assay. The parent compound 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin (8) was derived from a Friedlander condensation between the known aminopyridine derivative 3-(3-amino-4-picolylidene)-p-toluidine and optically active tricyclic ketone 7. Compound 8 had activity approximately twice that of (20S)-camptothecin in the calf thymus topoisomerase I cleavable complex assay. Compounds were prepared wherein the 11-aza nitrogen atom was quaternized as either the corresponding N-oxide or methyl iodide. Compounds with quaternized N-11 showed improved water solubility and were equipotent to the clinically investigated camptothecin analog topotecan in the cleavable complex assay. These compounds were evaluated in vivo in nude mice bearing HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenografts. The analog 11-aza-(20S)-camptothecin 11-N-oxide was found to significantly retard tumor growth when compared to untreated controls. Finally, 7,10-disubstituted 11-azacamptothecin analogs were synthesized using Pd(0) coupling reactions of 10-bromo-7-alkyl-11-aza-(20S)-camptothecins 19 and 20, which in turn were available from a Friedlander condensation of the novel bromopyridine derivatives 17a and 17b with 7. Among the 10-substituted series, a number of analogs displayed extremely high in vitro potency against topoisomerase I and improved aqueous solubility. A significant number of the compounds were found to be active in whole cell cytotoxicity assays and several were evaluated in nude mice bearing the HT-29 tumor xenografts. The most effective of these proved to be (S)-11-aza-7-ethyl-10-(aminohydroximinomethyl)camptothecin trifluoracetic acid salt (27), a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor which demonstrated excellent efficacy in both short term and in extended in vivo assays. A comparison between in vitro enzyme data and in vivo data from nude mouse studies in other compounds in this series revealed a poor overall correlation between topoisomerase inhibition in vitro and antitumor efficacy in vivo.

Title: Rigid analogs of camptothecin as DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors.

Abstract: Substituted 8-ethyl-2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindol-3-ylidene)-8-hydroxy-2,3,5,8- tetrahydro-6-oxa-3a-azacyclopenta[b]naphthalene-1,4,7-triones were synthesized and evaluated as topoisomerase I inhibitors in an in vitro cleavable complex assay. The activity of these compounds may be attributed to their rigid, planar geometry, and an attempt was made to correlate the SAR in this series to known attributes of camptothecin.

Title: Structure-activity relationships in a series of substituted indolocarbazoles: topoisomerase I and protein kinase C inhibition and antitumoral and antimicrobial properties.

Abstract: A series of compounds structurally related to staurosporine, rebeccamycin, and corresponding aglycones was synthesized, and their activities toward protein kinase C and topoisomerases I and II were tested together with their in vitro antitumor efficiency against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. Their antimicrobial activities were also examined against a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), a yeast (Candida albicans), and three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Streptomyces chartreusis, and Streptomyces griseus). To avoid side effects expected with protein kinase C inhibitors, we introduced substitution on the maleimide nitrogen and/or a sugar moiety linked to one of the indole nitrogens to obtain specific inhibitors of topoisomerase I with minimal activities on protein kinase C. As expected, these structures were inefficient on topoisomerase II, and some of them exhibited a strong activity against topoisomerase I. Generally, dechlorinated compounds were found to be more active than chlorinated analogues against both purified topoisomerase I and protein kinase C. On the other hand, opposite results were obtained in the cell antiproliferative assays. These results suggest lack of cell membrane permeability in the absence of the chlorine residue or cleavage of carbon-chlorine bonds inside the cell.

Title: Syntheses and biological activities of rebeccamycin analogues. Introduction of a halogenoacetyl substituent.

Abstract: In the course of structure-activity relationships on rebeccamycin analogues, a series of compounds bearing a halogenoacetyl substituent were synthesized with the expectation of increasing the interaction with DNA, possibly via covalent reaction with the double helix. Two rebeccamycin analogues bearing an acetyl instead of a bromoacetyl substituent were prepared to gain an insight into the role of the halogen atom. The new compounds show very little effect on protein kinase C and no covalent reaction with DNA was detected. However, the drugs behave as typical topoisomerase I poisons, and they are significantly more toxic toward P388 leukemia cells than to P388/CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. The introduction of a bromo- or chloro-acetyl substituent does not affect the capacity of the drug to interfere with topoisomerase I either in vitro or in cells. One of the bromoacetyl derivatives, compound 8, is the most cytotoxic rebeccamycin derivative among the hundred of derivatives we have synthesized to date. In addition, we determined the antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, and against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The effect of the drugs on Candida albicans yeast growth and their anti-HIV-1 activities were also measured.

Title: Substituted 2,5'-Bi-1H-benzimidazoles: topoisomerase I inhibition and cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Several 2'-aryl-5-substituted-2,5'bi-1H-benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as topoisomerase I poisons and for their cytotoxicity toward the human lymphoblast cell line RPMI 8402. This study focused on 18 2,5'-bi-1H-benzimidazole derivatives which contained either a 5-cyano, a 5-(aminocarbonyl), or a 5-(4-methylpiperazinyl) group. Among these bibenzimidazoles, the pharmacological activity of 2'-phenyl derivatives and the influence of the different positional isomers of either a 2'-tolyl group or a 2'-naphthyl moiety on cytotoxicity and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity were determined.

Title: Structural modifications of camptothecin and effects on topoisomerase I inhibition.

Abstract: Camptothecin (1), a potent antitumor alkaloid, is known to inhibit topoisomerase I, an enzyme that relaxes supercoiled DNA. Modifications have been made to the B, D, and E rings of this natural product. Specifically, compounds 2-10 either have an ester moiety in place of the E ring lactone, a methyl ester attached to position 14, a saturated (or nonexistent) deaza B ring, or contain a combination of these permutations. We have conducted in vitro assays against the topoisomerase I relaxation reaction which verify the necessity for a lactone in the E ring. Furthermore, steric requirements at position 14 are shown to be crucial for activity, and planarity of the A and B rings of camptothecin is also implicated in the ability of the drug to inhibit topoisomerase I. Speculation on the nature of the drug binding pocket is presented.

Title: Synthesis and evaluation of terbenzimidazoles as topoisomerase I inhibitors.

Abstract: The synthesis and pharmacological activity of a series of terbenzimidazoles are described. The ability of these derivatives to induce DNA cleavage in the presence of topoisomerase I was evaluated in vitro. These analogs were also assayed for their cytotoxicity in RPMI 8402 cells and the camptothecin-resistant CPT-K5 cells. In addition the potential for these compounds to serve as substrates for MDR1 was also determined. Several terbenzimidazoles exhibited similar cytotoxicity against variants of human tumor cells that either overexpress MDR1 or are camptothecin-resistant.

Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of cytotoxic 11-alkenylindenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors and indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrids.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a novel class of topoisomerase I (top1) inhibitors that are cytotoxic in cancer cell cultures and are therefore under development as potential anticancer agents. As inhibitors of the DNA religation reaction occurring after DNA cleavage by the enzyme, they are classified as top1 poisons, similar to the camptothecins. Two strategies were employed in order to further develop the structure-activity relationships of the indenoisoquinolines and enhance their therapeutic potential. The first strategy involved the synthesis of indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrid molecules to take advantage of a proposed structural analogy between the indenoisoquinolines and camptothecin. The desired hybrids were synthesized by reaction of halogenated phthalides with a dihydropyrroloquinoline. The second strategy involved the attachment of various alkenyl substituents to the C-11 position of the indenoisoquinolines, which were assumed to project into the DNA minor groove. The required C-11-substituted indenoisoquinolines were synthesized by McMurry reactions of 11-ketoindenoisoquinolines with aldehydes, and the geometries of the resulting alkenes were established by nuclear Overhauser effect difference NMR spectroscopy. All of the new indenoisoquinolines were examined for cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures as well as for activity vs top1. Although the indenoisoquinoline-camptothecin hybrid molecules proved to be less cytotoxic and displayed less activity against top1, an analogue incorporating a 3'-aminoalkenyl substituent at the C-11 position of the indenoisoquinoline system was significantly more potent than the prototype indenoisoquinoline in both assays. These results indicate that C-11 aminoalkyl substituents that are assumed to project into the minor groove enhance the cytotoxicity and top1 inhibitory activity of the parent indenoisoquinoline system.

Title: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors featuring polyamine side chains on the lactam nitrogen.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a class of noncamptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors that display significant cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures. They offer a number of potential advantages over the camptothecins, including greater chemical stability, formation of more persistent cleavage complexes, and induction of a unique pattern of DNA cleavage sites. Molecular modeling has suggested that substituents on the indenoisoquinoline lactam nitrogen would protrude out of the DNA duplex in the ternary cleavage complex through the major groove. This indicates that relatively large substituents in that location would be tolerated without compromising biological activity. As a strategy for increasing the potencies and potential therapeutic usefulness of the indenoisoquinolines, a series of compounds was synthesized containing polyamine side chains on the lactam nitrogen. The rationale for the synthesis of these compounds was that the positively charged ammonium cations would increase DNA affinity through electrostatic binding to the negatively charged DNA backbone, and the polyamines might also facilitate cellular uptake by utilization of polyamine transporters. The key step in the synthesis involved the condensation of Schiff bases, containing protected amine side chains, with substituted homophthalic anhydrides, to afford cis-3-aryl-4-carboxy-1-isoquinolones. These isoquinolones were then converted to indenoisoquinolines with thionyl chloride. Although monoamines were much more potent than the lead compound, no significant increase in potency was observed through incorporation of additional amino groups in the side chain. However, one of the monoamine analogues, which features a bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group in the side chain, proved to be one of the most cytotoxic indenoisoquinoline synthesized to date, with a GI50 mean-graph midpoint (MGM) of 0.07 microM in the NIH human cancer cell culture screen, and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity comparable to that of camptothecin.

Abstract: The indenoisoquinolines are a class of noncamptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors that display significant cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures. They offer a number of potential advantages over the camptothecins, including greater chemical stability, formation of more persistent cleavage complexes, and induction of a unique pattern of DNA cleavage sites. Molecular modeling has suggested that substituents on the indenoisoquinoline lactam nitrogen would protrude out of the DNA duplex in the ternary cleavage complex through the major groove. This indicates that relatively large substituents in that location would be tolerated without compromising biological activity. As a strategy for increasing the potencies and potential therapeutic usefulness of the indenoisoquinolines, a series of compounds was synthesized containing polyamine side chains on the lactam nitrogen. The rationale for the synthesis of these compounds was that the positively charged ammonium cations would increase DNA affinity through electrostatic binding to the negatively charged DNA backbone, and the polyamines might also facilitate cellular uptake by utilization of polyamine transporters. The key step in the synthesis involved the condensation of Schiff bases, containing protected amine side chains, with substituted homophthalic anhydrides, to afford cis-3-aryl-4-carboxy-1-isoquinolones. These isoquinolones were then converted to indenoisoquinolines with thionyl chloride. Although monoamines were much more potent than the lead compound, no significant increase in potency was observed through incorporation of additional amino groups in the side chain. However, one of the monoamine analogues, which features a bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino group in the side chain, proved to be one of the most cytotoxic indenoisoquinoline synthesized to date, with a GI50 mean-graph midpoint (MGM) of 0.07 microM in the NIH human cancer cell culture screen, and topoisomerase I inhibitory activity comparable to that of camptothecin.

Title: Benzo[f]azino[2,1-a]phthalazinium cations: novel DNA intercalating chromophores with antiproliferative activity.

Abstract: New azaquinolizinium-type cations have been obtained from isochromane. The synthesis was completed over seven steps and included as the key feature an intramolecular Westphal condensation. This first example of the intramolecular process allowed the preparation of benzo[f]pyrido[2,1-a]phthalazinium and benzo[f]quino[2,1-a]phthalazinium salts, which were evaluated as DNA intercalators, DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors, and antiproliferative compounds. Both cationic systems behave as DNA intercalators and exhibit antiproliferative activity. The pentacyclic benzo[f]quino[2,1-a]phthalazinium cations also have an inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of DNA topoisomerase I, without trapping of cleavage complexes. Structural characterization using density functional theory indicates that the fused ring systems are slightly nonplanar, and additional molecular modeling studies suggest a preferred orientation for the intercalating chromophores within a typical CpG or TpG intercalation site.

Title: Synthesis of new dihydroindeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline and indenoisoquinolinium chloride topoisomerase I inhibitors having high in vivo anticancer activity in the hollow fiber animal model.

Abstract: A number of novel dihydroindenoisoquinolines and indenoisoquinolinium salts were synthesized and examined for cytotoxicity in cancer cell cultures and for inhibition of topoisomerase I (top1). The top1-mediated DNA cleavage patterns produced in the presence of several of the new analogues were also investigated, and a few of the more potent compounds were examined for activity in hollow fiber animal models. Very cytotoxic dihydroindenoisoquinoline and isoquinolinium salts were obtained with mean graph midpoints (MGMs) for growth inhibition in the low submicromolar range. Two of the new dihydroindenoisoquinolines were found to be weaker top1 inhibitors than the lead compound 1, while two of the indenoisoquinolinium salts were more potent. The top1-mediated DNA cleavage patterns of the indenoisoquinolines examined were found to be similar to each other but different from that of camptothecin. Several of the more potent indenoisoquinolines displayed promising anticancer activities in hollow fiber animal models.

Title: Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel non-lactone analogues of camptothecin.

Abstract: Ten novel camptothecin (CPT) derivatives devoid of the lactone function in the E-ring were synthesized and evaluated as anticancer agents. Several of these CPT analogues bearing a five-membered E-ring are potent inhibitors of the DNA relaxation and cleavage reactions catalyzed by topoisomerase I and exhibit promising cytotoxic activities with IC(50) values in the nM range. This is the first successful design of lactone-free CPT, providing thus a new avenue to the development of topoisomerase I targeted antitumor agents.

Title: Synthesis of new indeno[1,2-c]isoquinolines: cytotoxic non-camptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors.

Abstract: In an attempt to design and synthesize potential anticancer agents acting by inhibition of topoisomerase I (top1), a new series of indenoisoquinolines was prepared and tested for cytotoxicity in human cancer cell cultures and for activity against top1. The synthesis relied on the condensation of substituted Schiff bases with homophthalic anhydrides to produce cis-3-aryl-4-carboxyisoquinolones that were cyclized to indenoisoquinolines in the presence of thionyl chloride. Both top1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity maximized in a single compound, 6-[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)aminopropyl]-5,6-dihydro-2,3-dimethoxy-8, 9-methylenedioxy-5,11-dioxo-11H-indeno[1,2-c]isoquinoline hydrochloride (19a), which proved to be a very potent top1 inhibitor having a 110 nM mean graph midpoint (MGM) when tested for cytotoxicity in 55 human cancer cell cultures. A number of structurally related indenoisoquinolines were also obtained that had both potent cytotoxicity as well as top1 inhibitory activity. The key feature of the more potent compounds was the presence of an aminoalkyl side chain on the indenoisoquinoline nitrogen atom. The DNA cleavage patterns induced by top1 in the presence of the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin. Some of the cleavage sites induced by the indenoisoquinolines were different from those seen with camptothecin, and conversely, camptothecin induced unique cleavage sites not apparent with the indenoisoquinolines. However, both camptothecin and the indenoisoquinolines also induced DNA cleavage sites that were the same in both series but varied in intensity. In addition, some of the DNA cleavages seen with the free base of 19a (compound 18c) in the presence of top1 were inhibited at higher drug concentrations, suggesting either a direct inhibition of the enzyme or an alternative mechanism involving DNA intercalation. Consistent with intercalation, compound 18c did unwind DNA.

Title: seco-Cyclothialidines: new concise synthesis, inhibitory activity toward bacterial and human DNA topoisomerases, and antibacterial properties.

Abstract: seco-Cyclothialidines are a promising class of bacterial DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors. A new seco-cyclothialidine derivative containing a dioxazine moiety, BAY 50-7952, was synthesized through a new concise pathway. One key step of the synthesis is the straightforward formation of the 2-aminothiazole derivative of S-tritylcysteine. In biological tests, BAY 50-7952 and other known seco-cyclothialidines exhibited high and selective activity toward bacterial DNA gyrase and toward Gram-positive bacteria. The dioxazine moiety and other similar groups were found to be important for the ability of the seco-cyclothialidines to penetrate bacterial membranes. The opposite enantiomer ((S)-form) of BAY 50-7952 was also synthesized, and neither significant target activity nor in vitro antibacterial activity were found, suggesting a highly selective fit of the (R)-form. Despite promising in vitro activity, only poor activity was found in the murine infection model.

Abstract: All four "symmetrical" regioisomers of ED-110, an indolocarbazole derivative having potent activity against human topoisomerase I (Topo I) were synthesized. The isomer containing hydroxyl groups in the 3- and 9-positions was approximately ten-fold more active against Topo I, and 5- to 35-fold more active against human solid tumor cell lines in vitro, relative to ED-110.

Title: Acylshikonin analogues: synthesis and inhibition of DNA topoisomerase-I.

Abstract: Compounds bearing an acyl group of a various size at 1'-OH of shikonin were synthesized as acyl analogues of shikonin, which was isolated from the root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, and evaluated for inhibitory effect on topoisomerase-I activity. A selective acylation at 1'-OH of shikonin in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine gave rise to a good yield of corresponding acylshikonin derivatives. In general, analogues with an acyl group of shorter chain lengths (C2-C6) exerted a stronger inhibitory action than those with longer chain lengths (C7-C20). While the halogen substitution at C-2 of the acetyl moiety failed to increase the inhibitory potency, the placement of double bonds in the acyl group (C5-C7) augmented the potency remarkably. Of the 32 derivatives evaluated, 15 compounds exhibited a higher inhibitory effect than shikonin. Noteworthy, the inhibitory potency of acetylshikonin, propanoylshikonin, and 4-pentenoylshikonin was approximately 4-fold greater than that of camptothecin. All these data suggest that the size of acyl moiety is important for the enhancement of potency, and the presence of olefinic double bonds is also beneficial.

Title: Antitumor agents. 166. Synthesis and biological evaluation of 5,6,7,8-substituted-2-phenylthiochromen-4-ones.

Abstract: As a continuation of our structure--activity relationship study of substituted 2-phenyl-4-quinolones and flavonoids as antitumor and antiviral agents, a series of 5,6,7,8-substituted-2-phenylthiochromen-4-ones has been synthesized by condensation of substituted thiophenols and ethyl benzoylacetates. Target compounds were evaluated for biological activity. Among them, compounds 7, 10, 12, and 13 displayed significant growth inhibitory action against a panel of tumor cell lines including human ileocecal carcinoma (HCT-8), murine leukemia (P-388), human melanoma (RPMI), and human central nervous system tumor (TE671) cells. Compounds 10, 12, and 19 displayed DNA topoisomerase I inhibitory activity in vitro and compound 11 was an in vitro, inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II. Compound 11 was most active (ED50 value, 0.65 microM) against HIV in acutely infected H9 lymphocytes and had a therapeutic index of about 5.
