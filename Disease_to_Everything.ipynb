            "Tumor immunotherapy has made great progress in recent years. In the tumor microenvironment, the binding of PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 can promote tumor immune escape and tumor survival. Clinical studies have indicated that antibodies blocking PD-1 and PD-L1 have reliable effects on many advanced malignant tumors. However, no small-molecule inhibitors have been approved so far, indicating that the development of marketable small-molecules PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapy drugs is a challenging process. Small-molecule inhibitors can overcome the limitations of monoclonal antibodies, including poor oral bioavailability, high cost, poor tissue and tumor penetration and long half-life, which prompt researchers to turn their attention to the development of peptide molecules and small-molecule inhibitors modulating PD-1/PD-L1 to overcome some disadvantages of monoclonal antibodies or targeting PD-L1 protein degradation as potential alternatives or supplements. In this review, we will focus on the peptide-based and nonpeptidic molecules against PD-1/PD-L1 base on the structural classification. More importantly, we also focus on the latest research progress of small-molecules mediated PD-L1 degradation mechanism.\n",
            "Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway with monoclonal antibodies has provided significant advances in cancer treatment. The antibody-based immunotherapies carry a number of disadvantages such as the high cost of the antibodies, their limited half-life, and immunogenicity. Development of small-molecule PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors that could overcome these drawbacks is slow because of the incomplete structural information for this pathway. The first chemical PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been recently disclosed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Here we present NMR and X-ray characterization for the two classes of these inhibitors. The X-ray structures of the PD-L1/inhibitor complexes reveal one inhibitor molecule located at the center of the PD-L1 homodimer, filling a deep hydrophobic channel-like pocket between two PD-L1 molecules. Derivatives of (2-methyl-3-biphenylyl)methanol exhibit the structures capped on one side of the channel, whereas the compounds based on [3-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-2-methylphenyl]methanol induce an enlarged interaction interface that results in the open \"face-back\" tunnel through the PD-L1 dimer.\n",

Currently, several immune checkpoint modulators, mainly monoclonal antibodies, are showing remarkable results. However, the failure to show a response in most patients and the induction of severe immune-related adverse effects are the major drawbacks. Novel approaches concerning the development of immune modulatory small molecules have emerged as an alternative. Nevertheless, the lack of structural information about immune checkpoint receptors has hindered the rational design of those small-molecule modulators by preventing the use of methodologies such as computer-aided drug design.

            "Therapeutic interference of the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1)/immunosuppressive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling pathway by monoclonal antibodies has achieved spectacular success for treating various tumors. However, the development of small molecule inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 has lagged far behind due to the challenge of targeting the highly hydrophobic and relatively flat binding interface, despite the benefits small molecule can bring over therapeutic antibodies. This technical challenge provokes the adoption of different strategies in searching for small, medium-sized, and large molecule modulators (e.g., degraders, downregulators, and covalent inhibitors) of the PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interaction. In this review article, we discuss latest advances in the development of PD-L1 modulators, with a focus on degraders, downregulators, and covalent inhibitors.\n",

            "Blocking the interaction of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 is known as a promising immunotherapy for treatment of a variety of tumors expressing PD-L1 on their cell surface. In the last decade, several antibodies against the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have been approved, while there are few reports of small-molecule inhibitors against PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Due to many advantages of cancer treatment with small molecules over antibodies, we developed several peptidic PD-L1 antagonists using computational peptide design methods, and evaluated them both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, among six peptides with best affinity to PD-L1, four peptides exhibited significant potency to block PD-1/PD-L1 axis at molecular level. Moreover, the PD-L1 expression in nine human colorectal cancer cell lines stimulated with interferon-γ was compared and LoVo cells with the highest expression were selected for further experiments. The peptides could also restore the function of activated Jurkat T cells, which had been suppressed by stimulated LoVo cells. A blockade assay in tumor-bearing mice experiments indicated that peptides HS5 and HS6 consisting of a d-amino acid in their structures, could also effectively reduce tumor growth in vivo, without induction of any observable liver or renal toxicity, tissue damages and loss of body weight. As new designed peptides showed no toxicity against murine colon cancer cells in vitro, the observed anti-tumor results in mice are most probably due to disrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Thus, peptides described in this study can be considered as proper low molecular weight candidates for immunotherapy of cancer.\n",

Currently marketed drugs targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway are all monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have achieved great success in clinical trials. With the constantly emerging problems of antibody drugs, small molecule inhibitors have attracted the attention of pharmaceutical chemists due to their controllable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties, which make them potential alternatives or supplements to mAbs to regulate PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. However, the insufficient target structure information hinders the development of small molecule inhibitors. Since the publication of human-PD-1/human-PD-L1 (hPD-1/hPD-L1) crystal structure, more and more cocrystal structures of mAbs, cyclopeptides and small molecules with PD-1 and PD-L1 have been resolved. These complexes provide a valuable starting point for the rational design of peptide-based and small synthetic molecule inhibitors. Here we reviewed the non-antibody inhibitors that have been published so far and analyzed their structure-activity relationships (SAR). We also summarized the cocrystal structures with hot spots identified, with the aim to provide reference for future drug discovery.\n",
